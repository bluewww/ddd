! =================================================================
! NOTE: If you're looking here for things to customize, look
! under the DDD `Options' menu first.  Many things are customizable
! from there.  Things which are settable via the Options dialog
! are stored in the ~/.dddinit file.
! =================================================================
!
! This file lists the default resources built into DDD.	 You can use the
! stuff in this file for examples of how to customize DDD for your
! environment; normally you will do this by copying the few lines you
! want to alter to your private resource database, which usually lives
! in a file called `.Xdefaults' in your home directory.	 You may also 
! place such lines in the DDD-specific `.dddinit' file in your home
! directory.
! 
! Site administrators **may** want to make changes here and install this
! file as the global app-defaults file for the site.  To do this, one
! would copy this file to `/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Ddd', or on SunOS,
! `/usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Ddd'.	(Actually this directory could
! be anywhere; only the person who installed X knows for sure.)
! 
! It is **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** that you not install this file in the
! `app-defaults' directory unless you are really sure you know what you
! are doing.  There are a whole slew of version-skew problems associated
! with app-defaults files, which are best avoided by simply not using
! them.	 In particular, if the app-defaults file for a program is
! installed, and you get a new version of that program, you can't
! properly test out the new version without actually installing it,
! since it will pick up the resources for the previous version, and will
! quite likely malfunction.
! 
! In short, app-defaults files are bad.	 Don't use them.  Use this file
! for informational purposes as suggested above.

! User-settable resources
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! The inferior debugger type (dbx, gdb, or xdb; defaults to gdb)
Ddd*debugger:


! The name under which the inferior debugger is to be invoked
! (default: debugger type)
Ddd*debuggerCommand:


! True if data and source are to be displayed in separate top-level
! windows.  If this is false, the data and source windows are attached
! to the DDD console window.
Ddd*Separate: true


! You may also attach the source window or data window alone.
! Ddd*separateDataWindow: true
! Ddd*separateSourceWindow: true


! True if programs are to be run in a separate top-level window.
! If this is false, input/output is sent to the DDD console window.
!
! Although a separate execution window has several advantages, it
! is less portable and more error-prone, which is why it is disabled 
! by default.
Ddd*separateExecWindow: false


! True if DDD windows are to be iconified/deiconified as a whole.
! If this is false, every DDD window can be iconified on its own.
Ddd*groupIconify: false


! True if the TAB key is to complete text in all DDD windows.
! If this is false, the TAB key completes in the DDD console window only.
Ddd*globalTabCompletion: true


! True if options are to be saved in ~/.dddinit across DDD invocations.
Ddd*saveOptionsOnExit: false


! The command to invoke a separate tty for showing I/O of the debugged
! program.  Bourne shell commands to run in the separate tty are appended
! to this string.
Ddd*termCommand: xterm \
-bg 'grey90' -fg 'black' \
-fn '-*-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-*-*-*-90-*-*-*-*-*-*' \
-title '@DDD@: Execution Window' -e /bin/sh -c


! The terminal type provided by `termCommand' (that is, the value of
! the TERM environment variable to be passed to the debugged program)
Ddd*termType: xterm


! The `useTTYCommand' resource sets the redirection mode for separate TTYs.
! Basically, there are two ways to redirect process I/O.  Both have
! advantages and disadvantages.
!
! * GDB provides a `tty' command to redirect I/O to a separate tty.
!   This is portable, but on some systems, there is the nasty side-effect
!   that redirection can not be undone.
!   For DBX, this means using the `dbxenv run_io pty' and `dbxenv run_pty'
!   commands to redirect I/O to a separate tty.
!   Set `useTTYCommand' to `true' to enable this behaviour.
! 
! * As an alternative, DDD can redirect the process I/O explicitly,
!   without using the `tty' command.  This is done with XDB and 
!   with DBX versions that do not support tty redirection.
!   Explicit redirection may fail if you use a non-standard shell.
!   Set `useTTYCommand' to `false' to enable this behaviour.
!   
! The default setting is `false', since explicit redirection is easier
! to handle (and to debug :-).	Maybe one day GDB will provide a way
! to undo redirection.
Ddd*useTTYCommand: false


! The `rsh' command to invoke tty-based commands on other hosts.
! On some systems, this is called `remsh'; on others, `on'.
! You may want to consult your system documentation for details.
Ddd*rshCommand: @RSH@


! The `print' command to print a postscript file.
! On some systems, this is called `lp'; on others, `lpr'.
! You may want to consult your system documentation for details.
Ddd*printCommand: @PRINT_COMMAND@


! Paper size, in format WIDTH x HEIGHT.	 (Default: A4).
Ddd*paperSize: 210mm x 297mm


! The `edit' command to invoke an editor on the specific file.
! `@LINE@' is replaced by the current line number,
! `@FILE@' by the file name.  Default is to invoke $XEDITOR first,
! then $EDITOR, then VI.
Ddd*editCommand: \
${XEDITOR=false} +@LINE@ @FILE@ \
|| xterm -e ${EDITOR=vi} +@LINE@ @FILE@


! Commands to list all executable/source/core/directory
! files matching @MASK@.
! These commands are executed on remote hosts only.
Ddd*listExecCommand:   \
	file @MASK@ | grep '.*:.*exec.*' | grep -v  '.*:.*script.*' \
	| cut -d: -f1 | grep -v '.*\\.o$'
Ddd*listSourceCommand: \
	file @MASK@ | grep '.*:.*text.*' | cut -d: -f1
Ddd*listCoreCommand:   \
	file @MASK@ | grep '.*:.*core.*' | cut -d: -f1
Ddd*listDirCommand:   \
	file @MASK@ | grep '.*:.*directory.*' | cut -d: -f1


! The DDD WWW page.
Ddd*wwwPage: http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/

! Command to invoke the WWW page.  @URL@ stands for the URL to open.
! Default is to try a running Netscape first, then to invoke a new 
! Netscape process, then to let a running Emacs do the job, then to
! invoke Mosaic, then to invoke Lynx.
! Note that if you don't have WWW access, letting all these commands fail
! may take a lot of time...
Ddd*wwwCommand: \
   netscape -remote 'openURL(@URL@)' \
|| netscape '@URL@' \
|| gnudoit '(w3-fetch \042@URL@\042)' \
|| mosaic '@URL@' \
|| Mosaic '@URL@' \
|| xterm -e lynx '@URL@'

! The time (in seconds) to wait for synchronous GDB questions to complete
Ddd*questionTimeout: 10


! Colon-separated lists of GDB commands for which buttons are to be created.
!
! All buttons send the named command to GDB.
! Commands ending with '...' insert their name, followed by a space.
! Commands ending with a control character insert the given
! control character.  As of DDD 1.5, commands ending with `()' insert
! the current contents of the argument field `()'.
!
! The following button names have special meanings:
! - `Clear'    : Clear current command
! - `Prev'     : Show previous command
! - `Next'     : Show next command
! - `Apply'    : Send the given command to GDB
! - `Back'     : Lookup previously selected source position
! - `Forward'  : Lookup next selected source position
! - `Edit'     : Edit current source file
! - `Reload'   : Reload source file
! - `Complete' : Complete current command
! - `Yes'      : Answer current GDB prompt
! - `No'       : Answer current GDB prompt

! The console window buttons (none: no buttons)
Ddd*consoleButtons:
! The following setting was effective in DDD 1.4d and earlier:
! Ddd*consoleButtons: \
!	Yes:No:interrupt^C
! Here is a very extensive setting:
! Ddd*consoleButtons: \
!	Yes:No:run:Clear:Prev:Next:Apply:interrupt^C

! The source window buttons (none: no buttons)
Ddd*sourceButtons:
! The following setting was effective in DDD 1.x:
! Ddd*sourceButtons:	    \
! run:step:next:stepi:nexti:cont:finish:kill:\
! up:down:Back:Forward:Edit:interrupt^C

! The command tool buttons, as of DDD 2.0 and later.
Ddd*toolButtons: \
run:break^C:step:stepi:next:nexti:cont:finish:\
up:down:Back:Forward:Edit:kill

! The number of rows in the command tool.
Ddd*tool_buttons.fractionBase:			8

! The positions are set up according to the following scheme:
! 
!    0 4 8	Each line has its individual number.
!  0 +-+-+	`topPosition' refers to the line above the button;
!    | | |	`bottomPosition' is the line below.  Likewise,
!  1 +-+-+	`leftPosition' is the line at the left, and
!    | | |	`rightPosition' is the line to the right.  For instance,
!  2 +-+-+	the line above the `break' button
!    | | |	is line 1 (topPosition), the line below is line 2
!  3 +-+-+	(bottomPosition), the line to the left is line 0
!    | | |	(leftPosition), and the line to the right is line 8
!  4 +-+-+	(rightPosition).
!    | | |	
!  5 +-+-+	To replace a button by another command, change the
!    | | |	`toolButtons' resource, above, and insert appropriate
!  6 +-+-+	resource values for the new button, specifying its
!    | | |	location.

Ddd*maxNameLength:	20


! Number of columns used for the code line number display.
! Should be a multiple of 8, to avoid confusion with TAB characters.
Ddd*indentAmount:	8


! The GDB initialization commands.  DDD depends on these settings,
! so don't change them unless required by your GDB version.
! Use a personal `~/.gdbinit' file instead to customize GDB.
!
! Users of GDB 4.12 and earlier may wish to add a line `display /x $pc',
! as these GDB versions do not issue the current PC location when source
! code is not available.
!
! Technically, the two commands `set print repeats 0' and 
! `set print asm-demangle on' are not required by DDD, but 
! this is frequently demanded by DDD users...
Ddd*gdbInitCommands:	\
set height 0\n\
set width 0\n\
set print repeats 0\n\
set verbose off\n\
set print asm-demangle on\n\
set prompt (gdb) \n


! The DBX initialization commands.  Nothing special yet.  
! Use a personal `~/.dbxinit' or `~/.dbxrc' file to customize DBX.
Ddd*dbxInitCommands:


! The XDB initialization commands.  Nothing special yet.
! Use a personal `~/.xdbrc' file to customize XDB.
Ddd*xdbInitCommands:


! The VSL library for displaying graph nodes.  `builtin' means the VSL
! library compiled into DDD, named `ddd.vsl'.  If you wish to use
! another VSL library, put its name here and set `vslPath' to a
! colon-separated list of directories where the VSL file and its
! includes can be found.
!
! If you use the builtin library, you can use the `vslDefs' resource,
! to override (customize) certain settings.  See `colors', below.
Ddd*vslLibrary:			builtin
Ddd*vslPath:			.

! Graph Editor Defaults
! What shall we use if the graph gets too large to be displayed?
! If true, an Athena panner is used (a kind of two-directional scrollbar).
! If false, two Motif scrollbars are used.
!
! Although a panned graph editor is much more comfortable, we set-up Motif
! scrollbars as a default: Many OSF/Motif installations choke
! on intermixed Motif/Athena applications and we don't want to get bug
! reports that should be directed to OSF.
Ddd*pannedGraphEditor:		false

! Nodes are moved when dragged more than 4 pixels.
Ddd*graph_edit.moveDelta:	4

! The selection tile pixmap.  Usual choices are Motif built-in pixmaps.
! If this resource is left unspecified, nodes are simply inverted.
! *graph_edit.selectTile:	25_foreground

! Do we wish opaque movement? (doesn't work yet)
Ddd*graph_edit.opaqueMove:	false

! Do we wish a grid?
Ddd*graph_edit.showGrid:	true

! Do we wish to snap the position to the grid?
Ddd*graph_edit.snapToGrid:	false

! Do we wish to show edge hints?
Ddd*graph_edit.showEdgeHints:	true

! What kind of layout do we wish? (regular, compact)
Ddd*graph_edit.layoutMode:	regular

! Do we wish to re-layout the graph after each change?
Ddd*graph_edit.autoLayout:	false

! Width and height of the grid
Ddd*graph_edit.gridWidth:	16
Ddd*graph_edit.gridHeight:	16


! Source defaults
! Do we wish to find complete words only?
Ddd*findWordsOnly:		true

! Do we wish to show machine code? (Makes DDD run somewhat slower)
Ddd*disassemble: false

! Do we wish to display glyphs? (Makes DDD run somewhat slower)
Ddd*displayGlyphs: true

! Do we wish to cache source files in memory?
Ddd*cacheSourceFiles:		true

! Do we wish to cache machine code in memory?
Ddd*cacheMachineCode:		true


! Focus policy
! POINTER means point-and-type, EXPLICIT means click-and-type.
! Rather than accepting the user's default, we use POINTER here because:
! 1. Using EXPLICIT focus policy works bad with a panned graph editor,
!    since Motif has trouble with assigning focus to Athena Widgets.
! 2. Several users use DDD in a non-Motif environment, where the click-to-type
!    methaphor is inappropriate.
! 3. DDD users usually are wither novices or experienced programmers,
!    who are often confused and/or embarrassed by explicit focus.
! Users unsatisfied with this setting can change it at run-time.
Ddd*keyboardFocusPolicy:	POINTER

! X Warnings
! Do we wish to suppress X warnings?
Ddd*suppressWarnings:		false

! A little less highlighting
Ddd*highlightThickness:		1

! @key is the font used for keys.
! @rm (roman), @sl (slanted), @bf (bold face), @bs (bold slanted)
! are some fonts for usual highlighting.
! @Logo and @logo are used in the DDD logo.

!
! The following settings may be useful:
! 
! - color(BOX, FOREGROUND, BACKGROUND) sets the FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND

Ddd*new_display_dialog_popup.title: @DDD@: New Display
Ddd*new_display_dialog.selectionLabelString:	\
@rm Enter new display expression:

Ddd*new_display_dialog*contextHelpString:	\
\
@rm Please enter a display expression in the argument field.\n\
The current value of the expression is shown each time the program stops.\n\
\n\
Variables accessible are those of the lexical environment of the selected\n\
stack frame, plus all those whose scope is global or an entire file.\n\
\n\
@tt $@sl NUM @rm gets previous value number @sl NUM@rm.\
  @tt $ @rm and @tt$$ @rm are the last two values.\n\
@tt $$@sl NUM @rm refers to @sl NUM@rm'th value back from the last one.\n\
Names starting with @tt$ @rm refer to registers\
 (with the values they would have\n\
if the program were to return to the stack frame now selected, restoring\n\
all registers saved by frames farther in) or else to debugger\n\
``convenience'' variables (any such name not a known register).\n\
Use assignment expressions to give values to convenience variables.\n\
\n\
@tt{@sl TYPE@tt}@sl ADREXP @rm refers to a datum of data type\
 @sl TYPE@rm, located at address @sl ADREXP@rm.\n\
\n\
@tt @ \
 @rm is a binary operator for treating consecutive data objects\n\
anywhere in memory as an array. @sl FOO@tt@ @sl NUM @rm\
 gives an array whose first\n\
element is @sl FOO@rm, whose second element is stored in the space following\n\
where @sl FOO @rm is stored, etc. @sl FOO @rm must be an expression \
whose value\n\
resides in memory.\n\
\n\
As a special extension, you can display ranges of array elements\n\
by using the notation @tt[@sl FROM@tt ..@sl TO@tt]@rm,\n\
where @sl FROM @rm and @sl TO @rm are the positions of the first\n\
and last array element to display.\n\
Thus, @tt argv[0..9] @rm will create 10 new displays\
  @tt argv[0]@rm, @tt argv[1]@rm ... @tt argv[9]@rm.
