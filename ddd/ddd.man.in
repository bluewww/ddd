.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.\" ---------------
.\"
The purpose of a debugger such as \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is to allow you to see
what is going on \*(lqinside\*(rq another program while it
executes\(em\&or what another program was doing at the moment it
crashed.
.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
.IP \(bu 2
Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
behavior.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Make your program stop on specified conditions.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
.PP
.\"
\*(lqClassical\*(rq \s-2UNIX\s+2 debuggers such as the \s-2GNU\s+2
debugger (\s-2GDB\s+2) provide a command-line interface and a
multitude of commands for these and other debugging purposes.
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 is a \fIwrapper\fR around an inferior \s-2GDB\s+2,
\s-2DBX\s+2, or \s-2XDB\s+2 debugger.  In addition to the command-line
interface of the inferior debugger, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides a common
\fIgraphical user interface\fR to support debugging tasks.  The
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 \fIgraphical data display\fR allows for interactive
exploration of data structures.
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "INVOKING @DDD@"
.\" ---------------
.\"
You can run \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with no arguments or options.  However, the
most usual way to start \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is with one argument or two,
specifying an executable program as the argument:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\ core\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want
to debug a running process:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\ 1234\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
would attach \s-2@DDD@\s+2 to process \c
.B 1234\c
\& (unless you also have a file
named `\|\c
.B 1234\c
\&\|'; \s-2@DDD@\s+2 does check for a core file first).
.\"
.PP
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 uses \s-2GDB\s+2 as inferior debugger.  Use
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-dbx program\fR
.br
.sp
or
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-xdb program\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
to run \s-2DBX\s+2 or \s-2XDB\s+2 as inferior debugger.
.PP
To learn more about \s-2@DDD@\s+2 options, run
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-help\fR
.br
.sp
to get a list of frequently used options, or see the `\fBOPTIONS\fR'
section, below.
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "THE DDD WINDOWS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-all.ps 15.3cm
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 is composed of three main windows:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIData Window\fR shows the current data of the debugged program.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fISource Window\fR shows the current source code of the debugged
program.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIDebugger Console\fR accepts debugger commands and shows
debugger messages.
.PP
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 groups these main windows into one single
window, but \s-2@DDD@\s+2 can also be configured to treat each one
separately.
.PP
Besides these main windows, there are some other optional windows
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fICommand Tool\fR offers buttons for frequently used commands.
It is usually placed on the source window.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIMachine Code Window\fR shows the current machine code.  It is
usually placed beneath the current source.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIExecution Window\fR shows the input and output of the debugged
program.
.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 also has several temporary \fIdialogs\fR for showing and
entering additional information.
.PP
In this manual page, we discuss all the functionality associated with
these windows.  We start with the debugger console and its commands,
continue with the source window, and continue with the data window.
But before that, we tell you how to get help while working with
\s-2@DDD@\s+2.
.\"
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "GETTING HELP"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.SS "Button Tips"
.\"
You can get a short help text on most \s-2@DDD@\s+2 buttons by simply
moving the mouse pointer on it and leave it there.  After a second, a
small window (called \fIbutton tip\fR) pops up, giving a hint on the
button's meaning.  The button tip disappears as soon as you move the
mouse pointer to another item.
.\"
.SS "The Status Line"
.\"
The status line also displays information about the currently selected
item.  By clicking on the status line, you can redisplay the most
recent messages.
.\"
.SS "Context-Sensitive Help"
.\"
You can get detailed help on any visible \s-2@DDD@\s+2 item by pressing the
`\fBF1\fR' key and moving the question mark arrow on the item you
want help for.  Clicking on the item pops up a detailed help text.
.PP
The \s-2@DDD@\s+2 dialogs all contain `\fBHelp\fR' buttons that give
detailed information about the dialog.
.\"
.SS "Help on Debugger Commands"
.\"
You can get help on \s-2GDB\s+2 and \s-2DBX\s+2 commands by entering
`\fBhelp\fR' at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' or `\fB(dbx)\fR' prompt.  You can
get help on \s-2XDB\s+2 commands by entering `\fBhelp\fR' at the
`\fB>\fR' prompt.
.PP
See the following section for details on entering commands.
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "ENTERING COMMANDS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
In the \fIdebugger console\fR, you can interact with the command
interface of the inferior debugger.  Enter commands at the \fIdebugger
prompt\fR\(em\&that is, `\fB(gdb)\fR' for \s-2GDB\s+2, `\fB(dbx)\fR'
for \s-2DBX\s+2, and `\fB>\fR' for \s-2XDB\s+2.  You can use arbitrary
debugger commands; use the \s-2\fBRETURN\fR\s+2 key to enter them.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-console.ps 15.3cm
.PP
You can \fIrepeat\fR previous and next commands by pressing the
`\fBUp\fR' and `\fBDown\fR' arrow keys, respectively.  If you enter an
empty line, the last command is repeated as well.  `\fBCommands |
Command History\fR' shows the command history.
.PP
You can \fIsearch\fR for previous commands by pressing `\fBCtrl+R\fR'.
This invokes \fIincremental search mode,\fR where you can enter a
string to be searched in previous commands.  Press `\fBCtrl+R\fR'
again to repeat the search, or `\fBCtrl+S\fR' to search in the reverse
direction.  To return to normal mode, press \s-2\fBESC\fR\s+2, or use
any cursor command.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-history.ps 15.3cm
.PP
Using \s-2GDB\s+2, you can also \fIcomplete\fR commands and arguments
by pressing the `\s-2\fBTAB\fR\s+2' key; pressing the `\s-2\fBTAB\fR\s+2'
key multiple times shows one possible expansion after the other.
.PP
Here are some of the most frequently needed debugger commands.

.\" ---------------
.SH "OPENING FILES"
.\" ---------------
.\"
If you did not invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2 specifying a program to be debugged,
you can use the `\fBFile\fR' menu to open programs, core dumps and
sources.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-open.ps 15.3cm
.PP
To open a program to be debugged, select `\fBFile | Open Program\fR'.
.PP
To open a core dump for the program, select `\fBFile | Open Core
Dump\fR' Before `\fBOpen Core Dump\fR', you should first use `\fBFile
| Open Program\fR' to specify the program that generated the core dump
and to load its symbol table.
.PP
To open an arbitrary source file, select `\fBFile | Open Source\fR'.
This works best if the given source file is actually related to the
debugged program.
.PP
Note: With \s-2XDB\s+2 and some \s-2DBX\s+2 versions, the debugged
program must be specified upon invocation and cannot be changed at run
time.
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "LOOKING UP ITEMS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
If the source of the debugged program is available, the \fIsource
window\fR displays its current source text.  (If a source text cannot
be found, use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBdirectory\fR' command to specify
source text directories).
.PP
In the source window, you can lookup and examine function and variable
definitions as well as search for arbitrary occurrences in the source
text.
.\"
.SS "Looking up Definitions"
.\"
If you wish to lookup a specific function or variable definition whose
name is visible in the source text, click with the \fIleft mouse
button\fR on the function or variable name.  The name is copied to the
argument field.  Click on the `\fBLookup ()\fR' button to find its
definition.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-source-popup.ps 15.3cm
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the function name and select the `\fBLookup\fR' item from
the source popup menu.
.PP
As another alternative, you can enter the function name in the
argument field and click on the `\fBLookup ()\fR' button to find its
definition.
.PP
Finally, you can use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBinfo line\fR' command.
Type `\fBhelp info line\fR' at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt for
details.
.\"
.SS "Textual Search"
.\"
If the item you wish to search is visible in the source text, click
with the \fIleft mouse button\fR on it.  The identifier is copied to
the argument field.  Click on the `\fBFind\s-2>>\s+2 ()\fR' button to find
following occurrences and on the  `\fBFind\s-2<<\s+2 ()\fR' button to find
previous occurrences.
.PP
As an alternative, you can enter the item in the argument field and
click on one of the `\fBFind\fR' buttons.
.PP
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 finds only complete words.  To search for
arbitrary substrings, change the value of the `\fBOptions | Find Words
Only\fR' option.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-source.ps 15.3cm
.\"
.SS "Looking up Previous Locations"

Use the `\fBBack\fR' and `\fBForward\fR' buttons to lookup previous or
next locations.  The location found is underlined.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "BREAKPOINTS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
Using the source window, you can make the program stop at certain
\fIbreakpoints\fR and trace its execution.
.\"
.SS "Setting Breakpoints by Location"
.\"
If the source line is visible, click with the \fIleft mouse button\fR
on the left of the source line and then on the `\fBBreak at ()\fR'
button.
.PP
As an alternative, you can simply press the \fIright mouse button\fR
on the left of the source line and select the `\fBSet Breakpoint\fR' item
from the line popup menu.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-line-popup.ps 15.3cm
.PP
As another alternative, you can enter the line number in the argument
field (indicated by `\fB():\fR') and click on the `\fBBreak at ()\fR'
button.
.PP
As yet another alternative, you can select `\fBSource | Edit
Breakpoints\fR'.  Click on the `\fBNew\fR' button and enter the line
number.
.PP
And finally, you can also use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBbreak\fR' command or
the \s-2DBX\s+2 `\fBstop\fR' command.  Type `\fBhelp break\fR' at the
`\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt (or `\fBhelp stop\fR' at the `\fB(dbx)\fR'
prompt) for details.  The \s-2XDB\s+2 `\fBb\fR' command works as well.
.PP
(If you find this number of alternatives confusing, be aware that
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 users fall into three categories, which must all be
supported.  \fINovice users\fR explore \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and may prefer to
use one single mouse button.  \fIAdvanced users\fR know how to use
shortcuts and prefer popup menus.  \fIExperienced users\fR prefer the
command line interface.)
.PP
Breakpoints are indicated by a plain stop sign, 
or as `\fB#\fIn\fB#\fR', where \fIn\fR is the breakpoint number.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Setting Breakpoints by Name"
.\"
If the function name is visible, click with the \fIleft
mouse button\fR on the function name.  The function name is copied to
the argument field.  Click on the `\fBBreak at ()\fR' button to set a
breakpoint there.
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press the \fIright
mouse button\fR on the function name and select the `\fBbreak\fR' item
from the popup menu.
.PP
As another alternative, you can enter the function name in the
argument field (possibly using name completion by pressing the
`\fB\s-2TAB\s+2\fR' key) and click on the `\fBBreak at ()\fR' button.
.PP
As yet another alternative, you can click on `\fBNew\fR' from the
Breakpoint editor (invoked through `\fBSsource | Edit Breakpoints\fR')
and enter the function name.
.PP
Finally, you can use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBbreak\fR' command or the
\s-2DBX\s+2 `\fBstop\fR' command.  Type `\fBhelp break\fR' at the
`\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt (or `\fBhelp stop\fR' at the `\fB(dbx)\fR'
prompt) for details.  The \s-2XDB\s+2 `\fBb\fR' command works as well.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Disabling Breakpoints"
.\"
Note: \s-2DBX\s+2 does not support breakpoint disabling.
.PP
To temporarily disable a breakpoint, press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the breakpoint name and select the `\fBDisable
Breakpoint\fR' item from the breakpoint popup menu.  To enable it
again, select `\fBEnable Breakpoint\fR'.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-bp-popup.ps 15.3cm
.PP
As an alternative, you can select the breakpoint and click on
`\fBDisable\fR' or `\fBEnable\fR' in the Breakpoint editor (invoked
through `\fBSource | Edit Breakpoints\fR'.
.PP
Disabled breakpoints are indicated by a grey stop sign, or 
`\fB_\fIn\fB_\fR', where \fIn\fR is the breakpoint number.
.PP
Finally, you can use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBdisable\fR' command.  Type
`\fBhelp disable\fR' at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt for details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Temporary Breakpoints"
.\"
A \fItemporary breakpoint\fR is immediately deleted as soon as it is
reached.  To set a temporary breakpoint, press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the left of the source line and select the `\fBSet
Temporary Breakpoint\fR' item from the popup menu.
.PP
Temporary breakpoints are convenient to make the program continue up
to a specific location: just set the temporary breakpoint at this
location and continue execution.
.PP
The `\fBContinue Until Here\fR' item from the popup menu sets a
temporary breakpoint on the left of the source line and immediately
continues execution.  In \s-2GDB\s+2, execution stops when a source
line greater than the source line is reached, or when the current
stack frame is exited.  In \s-2DBX\s+2 and \s-2XDB\s+2, execution
stops when the temporary breakpoint is reached.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Deleting Breakpoints"
.\"
If the breakpoint is visible, click with the \fIleft mouse button\fR
on the breakpoint.  The breakpoint location is copied to the argument
field.  Click on the `\fBClear at ()\fR' button to delete all
breakpoints there.
.PP
If the function name is visible, click with the \fIleft mouse
button\fR on the function name.  The function name is copied to the
argument field.  Click on the `\fBClear at ()\fR' button to set a
breakpoint there.
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the breakpoint and select the `\fBDelete Breakpoint\fR'
item from the popup menu.
.PP
As yet another alternative, you can select the breakpoint and click on
`\fBDelete\fR' in the Breakpoint editor (invoked through `\fBSource |
Edit Breakpoints\fR').
.PP
Finally, you can use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBclear\fR' and `\fBdelete\fR'
commands.  Type `\fBhelp clear\fR' or `\fBhelp delete\fR' at
the `\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt for details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Finding Breakpoints"
.\"
If you wish to lookup a specific breakpoint, select `\fBSource | Edit
Breakpoints | Lookup\fR'.  After selecting a breakpoint from the list
and clicking the `\fBLookup\fR' button, the breakpoint location is
displayed.
.PP
As an alternative, you can enter `\fB#\fIn\fR' in the argument field,
where \fIn\fR is the breakpoint number and click on the `\fBLookup ()\fR'
button to find its definition.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Breakpoint Conditions"
.\"
Using the Breakpoint Editor (invoked through `\fBSource | Edit
Breakpoints\fR'), you can specify \fIbreakpoint conditions\fR.
Reaching the breakpoint stops the program only if the associated
condition is met\(em\&that is, if the condition expression evaluates
to a non-zero value.
.PP
To set a breakpoint condition, select the appropriate breakpoint in
the Breakpoint Editor and click on the `\fBCondition\fR' button.
You can then enter (or change) the condition in a special dialog.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-cond.ps 15.3cm
.PP
As a faster alternative, you can also press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the breakpoint in the source code and select the `\fBSet
Condition\fR' item from the popup menu.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Breakpoint Ignore Counts"
.\"
Using the Breakpoint Editor (invoked through `\fBSource | Edit
Breakpoints\fR'), you can specify \fIignore counts\fR.  If an ignore
count is set, each crossing of the breakpoint decrements the ignore
count.  The program stops only if the ignore count is zero.
.PP
To set a breakpoint ignore count, select the appropriate breakpoint in
the Breakpoint Editor and click on the `\fBIgnore Count\fR' button.
You can then enter (or change) the ignore count in a special dialog.

.\"
.SS "Starting Program Execution"
.\"
Select `\fBProgram | Run\fR' to start execution of the debugged
program.  You will then be prompted for the arguments to give to your
program.  You can either select from a list of previously used
arguments or enter own arguments in the text field.  Afterwards, press
the `\fBOK\fR' button to start execution with the selected arguments.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-arguments.ps 15.3cm
.PP
To run your program again, with the same arguments, select `\fBProgram
| Run Again\fR' or press the `\fBRun\fR' button on the command tool.
You may also enter `\fBrun\fR', followed by arguments at the debugger
prompt instead.
.PP
By default, input and output of the debugged program go to the
debugger console.  As an alternative, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 can also invoke an
\fIexecution window\fR, where the program terminal input and output is
shown.  See `\fBOptions | Run in Execution Window\fR' for details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Attaching to a Running Process"
.\"
If the debugged program is already running in some process, you can
\fIattach\fR to this process (instead of starting a new one with
`\fBRun\fR').  Select `\fBFile | Attach to Process\fR' to choose from
a list of processes.  Afterwards, press the `\fBAttach\fR' button to
attach to the specified process.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-attach.ps 15.3cm
.PP
The first thing \s-2@DDD@\s+2 does after arranging to debug the
specified process is to stop it. You can examine and modify an
attached process with all the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 commands that are
ordinarily available when you start processes with `\fBRun\fR'. You
can insert breakpoints; you can step and continue; you can modify
storage. If you would rather the process continue running, you may use
`\fBContinue\fR' after attaching \s-2@DDD@\s+2 to the process.
.PP
When using `\fBAttach to Process\fR', you should first use `\fBOpen
Program\fR' to specify the program running in the process and load its
symbol table.
.PP
When you have finished debugging the attached process, you can use the
`\fBFile | Detach Process\fR' to release it from \s-2@DDD@\s+2
control.  Detaching the process continues its execution.  After
`\fBDetach Process\fR', that process and \s-2@DDD@\s+2 become
completely independent once more, and you are ready to attach another
process or start one with `\fBRun\fR'.
.PP
You can customize the list of processes shown.  See the
`\fBpsCommand\fR' resource for details.

You can interrupt a running program any time by clicking the
`\fBInterrupt\fR' button or typing \fBCtrl+C\fR in a \s-2@DDD@\s+2 window.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Resuming Execution"
.\"
To resume execution, at the address where your program last stopped,
click on the `\fBContinue\fR` button.  Any breakpoints set at that
address are bypassed.
.PP
To execute just one source line, click on the `\fBStep\fR' button.
The program is executed until control reaches a different source line,
which may be in a different function.
.PP
To continue to the next line in the current function, click on the
`\fBNext\fR' button.  This is similar to `\fBStep\fR', but any
function calls appearing within the line of code are executed without
stopping.
.PP
To continue running until the current function returns, use the
`\fBFinish\fR' button.  The returned value (if any) is printed.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-tool.ps 15.3cm

.\"
.SS "Examining the Stack"
.\"
When your program has stopped, the first thing you need to know is
where it stopped and how it got there.
.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides a \fIbacktrace window\fR showing a summary of 
how your program got where it is.  To enable the backtrace window,
select `\fBStatus | Backtrace\fR'.
.PP
The `\fBUp\fR' button selects the function that called the current
one.
.PP
The `\fBDown\fR' button selects the function that was called by
the current one.
.PP
You can also directly type the `\fBup\fR' and `\fBdown\fR' commands at

.SS "Examining Threads"
.\"
Note: Thread support is available with \s-2GDB\s+2 only.
.\"
In some operating systems, a single program may have more than one
\fIthread\fR of execution.  The precise semantics of threads differ
from one operating system to another, but in general the threads of a
single program are akin to multiple processes\(em\&except that they
share one address space (that is, they can all examine and modify the
same variables).  On the other hand, each thread has its own registers
and execution stack, and perhaps private memory.
.PP
For debugging purposes, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 lets you display the list of
threads currently active in your program and lets you select the
\fIcurrent thread\fR\(em\&the thread which is the focus of debugging.
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 shows all program information from the perspective of
the current thread.

.SH "EXAMINING DATA"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.TP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides three means to examine data.
.TP 10
.B "Value Hints"
The quickest way to examine variables is to move the pointer on an
occurrence in the source text.  The value is displayed in the source
line; after a second, a popup window shows the variable value.  This
is useful for quick examination of several simple variables.
.TP 10
.B "Printing Values"
If you want to reuse variable values at a later time, you can print
the value in the debugger console.  This allows for displaying and
examining larger data structures.
.TP 10
.B "Displaying Values"
If you want to examine complex data structures, you can display them
graphically in the data display.  Displays remain effective until you
delete them; they are updated each time the program stops.  This is
useful for large dynamic structures.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS "Displaying Simple Values"
.\"
To display the value of a simple variable, move the mouse pointer on
its name.  After a second, a small window (called \fIvalue tip\fR)
pops up showing the value of the variable pointed at.  The window
disappears as soon as you move the mouse pointer away from the
variable.  The value is also shown in the status line.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-value-tip.ps 15.3cm
.PP
The variable value can also be printed in the debugger console, making
it available for further operations.  To print a variable value,
select the desired variable by clicking the \fIleft mouse button\fR on
its name.  The variable name is copied to the argument field.  By
clicking the `\fBPrint ()\fR' button, a new display is created in the
data window.
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the variable name and select the `\fBPrint\fR' item from
the popup menu.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-print-popup.ps 15.3cm
.\"
.SS "Displaying Complex Values"
.\"
To explore complex data structures, you can use the \fIgraphical data
display\fR in the \fIdata window\fR.  The data window holds
\fIdisplays\fR showing names and the values of variables.  The display
is updated each time the program stops.
.PP
To create a new display, select the desired variable by clicking the
\fIleft mouse button\fR on its name.  The variable name is copied to
the argument field.  By clicking the `\fBDisplay ()\fR' button, a new
display is created in the data window.
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the variable name and select the `\fBDisplay\fR' item from
the popup menu.
.PP
As another alternative, you may also enter the expression to be
displayed in the argument field and press the `\fBDisplay ()\fR'
button.
.PP
If the data window is visible, you may click on the `\fBNew
Display\fR' button.  Enter the expression to be displayed in the
resulting prompt dialog.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-new-display.ps 15.3cm

Finally, you may also enter
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display \fIexpr\fR [\|\fBat (\fIx, y\fB)\fR\|] [\|\fBdependent
on \fIdisplay\fR\|]
.sp
.br
\&at the debugger prompt.  If the suffix `\fBat \fB(\fIx, y\fB)\fR' is
specified, the new data display is created at the position (\fIx\fR,
\fIy\fR); otherwise, a default position is assigned.  If the suffix
`\fBdependent on \fIdisplay\fR' is given, an edge from display
numbered \fIdisplay\fR to the new display is created; otherwise, no
edge is created.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Selecting Displays"
.\"
Each display in the data window has a \fItitle bar\fR containing the
\fIdisplay number\fR and the displayed expression (the \fIdisplay
name\fR).  Below the title, the \fIdisplay value\fR is shown.
.PP
You can select individual displays by clicking on them with the
\fIleft mouse button\fR.  The resulting expression is shown in the
\fIargument field\fR, below.
.PP
You can \fIextend\fR an existing selection by pressing the \fBShift\fR
key while selecting.  You can also \fItoggle\fR an existing selection
by pressing the \fBShift\fR key while selecting already selected
displays.
.PP
Single displays may also be selected by using the arrow keys.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Selecting Multiple Displays"
.\"
Multiple displays are selected by pressing and holding the \fIleft
mouse button\fR somewhere on the window background.  By moving the
pointer while holding the button, a selection rectangle is shown; all
displays fitting in the rectangle are selected when the mouse button
is released.
.PP
If the \fBShift\fR key is pressed while selecting, the existing
selection is \fIextended\fR.
.PP
By double-clicking on a display, the display itself and all connected
displays are automatically selected.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-select-display.ps 15.3cm

.\"
.\"
.SS "Selecting Display Parts"
.\"
If a display is composed from several values (that is, a C/C++
\fIclass\fR, \fIstruct\fR, \fIunion\fR, or \fIarray\fR; or a
Pascal/Modula \fIRECORD\fR or \fIARRAY\fR), you can
select individual parts by clicking on their names or values.  The
resulting expression is shown in the \fIargument field\fR, below.
.PP
Selection of multiple display parts is not supported.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Showing and Hiding Values"
.\"
\fIAggregate Values\fR can be shown \fIexpanded\fR, that is,
displaying all details, or \fIhidden\fR, that is, displayed as
`\fB{...}\fR'.
.PP
To show details about an aggregate, select the aggregate by clicking
the \fIleft mouse button\fR on its name or value and click on the
`\fBShow ()\fR' button.  Details are shown for the aggregate itself as
well as for all contained sub-aggregates.
.PP
To hide details about an aggregate, select the aggregate by clicking
the \fIleft mouse button\fR on its name or value and click on the
`\fBHide ()\fR' button.
.PP
As a faster alternative, you can also press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the aggregate and select the appropriate menu item.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-hide-display.ps 15.3cm

.br
  \fBgraph enable display \fIdisplays...\fR
.sp
.br
at the debugger prompt.  \fIdisplays...\fR is a space-separated list
of display numbers to disable or enable.

.SS "Rotating Arrays"
.\"
Arrays can be aligned horizontally or vertically.  To change the
alignment of an array, select it and then click on the `\fBRotate
()\fR' button.
.PP
As a faster alternative, you can also press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the array and select the `\fBRotate\fR' menu item.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-rotate-display.ps 15.3cm
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS "Displaying Dependent Values"
.\"
Dependent displays are created from an existing display.  The
dependency is indicated by arrows leading from the originating display
to the dependent display.
.PP
To create a dependent display, select the originating display or
display part and click on the `\fBNew Display\fR' button.  A prompt
dialog appears where you can enter a new expression \fIEXPR\fR in the
argument field.  By clicking on `\fBOK\fR', the new display showing
\fIEXPR\fR is created.
.PP
As a faster alternative, you can also press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the originating display part and select the `\fBNew
Display\fR' menu item.
.PP
Using dependent displays, you can investigate the data structure of a
\*(lqtree\*(rq for example and lay it out according to your intuitive
image of the \*(lqtree\*(rq data structure.
.PP
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 does not recognize shared data structures
(i.e. a data object referenced by multiple other data objects).  See
the section on \fIExamining Shared Data Structures\fR, below, for
details on how to examine such structures.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Dereferencing Pointers"
.\"
Since so many data structures are realized using pointers, there is a
shortcut for creating dependent displays showing the value of a
dereferenced pointer.
.PP
To dereference a pointer, select the originating pointer value or name
and click on the `\fBDisplay * ()\fR' button.  A new display showing
the dereferenced pointer value is created.
.PP
As a faster alternative, you can also press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the originating pointer value or name and select the
`\fBDisplay *\fR' menu item.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Displaying Local Variables"
.\"
You can display all local variables at once by choosing `\fBData |
Display Local Variables\fR'.  When you using \s-2DBX\s+2 or
\s-2XDB\s+2, this displays all local variables, including the
arguments of the current function.  When you are using \s-2GDB\s+2,
function arguments are contained in a separate display, activated by
`\fBDisplay Arguments\fR'.
.PP
The display showing the local variables can be manipulated just like
any other data display.  Individual variables can be selected and
dereferenced.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-locals.ps 15.3cm
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS "Displaying Program Status"
.\"
Besides local variables, you can create a display from the output of
an arbitrary debugger command.  By entering
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display `\fIcommand\fB`\fR
.sp
.br
the output of \fIcommand\fR is turned into a \fIstatus display\fR
updated each time the program stops.  For instance, by entering
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display `where`\fR
.sp
.br
a status display named `\fBWhere\fR' is created that shows the current
backtrace.
.PP
If you are using \s-2GDB\s+2, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides a panel from
which you can choose useful status displays.  Select `\fBData |
Status Displays\fR' and pick your choice from the list.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-status-displays.ps 15.3cm
.PP
Note that status displays are quite time-consuming, so you
should delete them as soon as you don't need them any more.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Displaying Multiple Array Items"
.\"
When debugging C or C++ programs, one often has to deal with pointers
to arrays of dynamically determined size.  Both \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and
\s-2GDB\s+2 provide special support for such dynamic arrays.
.PP
To display several successive objects of the same type (a section of
an array, or an array of dynamically determined size), use the
notation \fB[\fIFROM\fB..\fITO\fB]\fR in display expressions.
\fIFROM\fR and \fITO\fR denote the first and last array position to
display.  Thus,
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display argv[0..9]\fR
.sp
.br
creates ten new display nodes for `\fBargv[0]\fR',
`\fBargv[1]\fR', ..., `\fBargv[9]\fR'.
.PP
Using \s-2GDB\s+2 as inferior debugger, you can use \fIartificial arrays\fR.
Typing
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display argv[0] @ 10\fR
.sp
.br
creates a single array display node containing `\fBargv[0]\fR' up to
`\fBargv[9]\fR'.  Generally, by using the `\fB@\fR' operator, you
can specify the number of array elements to be displayed.
.PP
For more details on artificial arrays, see the \s-2GDB\s+2 documentation.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Altering Variable Values"
.\"
Using the `\fBSet ()\fR' button or the `\fBSet Value\fR' menu item in
the data popup menu, you can alter the value of the selected variable,
to resume execution with the changed value.  In a dialog, you can
modify the variable value at will; clicking the `\fBOK\fR' or
`\fBApply\fR' button commits your change.
.PP
Note that most inferior debuggers have no support for changing entire
structures; you must change each primitive structure member
separately.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-set.ps 15.3cm
.\"
.\"
.SS "Deleting Displays"
.\"
To delete a single display, select it and click on the `\fBDelete ()\fR'
button.  As an alternative, you can also press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the display and select the `\fBDelete Display\fR' item.
.PP
When a display is deleted, its immediate ancestors and descendants are
automatically selected, so that you can easily delete entire graphs.
.PP
To delete several displays at once, select the `\fBDelete\fR' item in
the Display Editor (invoked through the `\fBData | Edit
Displays...\fR').  Select any number of display items in the usual way
and delete them by pressing `\fBDelete\fR'.
.PP
As an alternative, you can also type
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph undisplay \fIdisplays...\fR
.sp
.br
at the debugger prompt, where \fIdisplays...\fR is a space-separated
list of display numbers to delete.

.\"
.SS "Examining Shared Data Structures"
.\"
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 does not recognize shared data
structures\(em\&that is, a data object referenced by multiple other
data objects.  For instance, if two pointers \fBp1\fR and \fBp2\fR
point at the same data object \fBd\fR, the data displays \fBd\fR,
\fB*p1\fR, and \fB*p2\fR will be separate, although they denote the
same object.
.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides a special mode which makes it detect these
situations.  \s-2@DDD@\s+2 recognizes if two or more data displays are
stored at the same physical address, and if this is so, merges all
these \fIaliases\fR into one single data display, the \fIoriginal data
display\fR.  This mode is called \fIAlias Detection\fR; it is enabled
via the `\fBData | Detect Aliases\fR'.
.PP
When alias detection is enabled, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 inquires the memory
location (the \fIaddress\fR) of each data display after each program
step.  If two displays have the same address, they are merged into
one.  More specifically, only the one which has least recently changed
remains (the \fIoriginal data display\fR); all other aliases are
\fIsuppressed\fR, i.e. completely hidden.  The edges leading to the
aliases are replaced by edges leading to the original data display.
.PP
An edge created by alias detection is somewhat special: rather than
connecting two displays directly, it goes through an \fIedge hint\fR,
describing an arc connecting the two displays and the edge hint.
.PP
Each edge hint is a placeholder for a suppressed alias; selecting an
edge hint is equivalent to selecting the alias.  This way, you can
easily delete display aliases by simply selecting the edge hint and
clicking on `\fBDelete ()\fR'.
.PP
Edge hints can be made invisible by disabling `\fBOptions | Preferences | Data
Preferences | Show Edge Hints\fR'.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-aliases.ps 15.3cm
.PP
To access suppressed display aliases, you can also use the Display
Editor.  Suppressed displays are listed in the Display Editor as
\fIaliases\fR of the original data display.  Via the Display Editor,
you can select, change, and delete suppressed displays.
.PP
.PSPIC PICS/ddd-edit-displays.ps 15.3cm
.PP
Suppressed displays become visible again as soon as
.br
.IP \(bu 2
alias detection is disabled,

.IP \(bu 2
the original data display is deleted, such that the least recently
changed alias becomes the new original data display.
.PP
Please note the following \fIcaveats\fR with alias detection:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Alias detection requires that the current programming language
provides a means to determine the address of an arbitrary data
object.  Currently, only C and C++ are supported.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Some inferior debuggers (for instance, SunOS \s-2DBX\s+2) produce
incorrect output for address expressions.  Given a pointer \fBp\fR,
you may verify the correct function of your inferior debugger by
comparing the values of \fBp\fR and \fB&p\fR (unless \fBp\fR actually
points to itself).  You can also examine the data display addresses,
as shown in the Display Editor.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Alias detection slows down \s-2@DDD@\s+2 considerably, which is why it
is disabled by default.  You may consider to enable it only at
need\(em\&for instance, while examining some complex data
structure\(em\&and disable it while examining control flow (i.e.,
stepping through your program).  \s-2@DDD@\s+2 will automatically
restore edges and data displays when switching modes.
.PP
.\"

.SS "Moving Displays Around"
.\"
From time to time, you may wish to move displays at another place in
the data window.  You can move a single display by pressing and
holding the \fIleft mouse button\fR on the display title.  Moving the
pointer while holding the button causes all selected displays to move
along with the pointer.
.PP
If the data window becomes too small to hold all displays, scroll bars
are created.  If your \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is set up to use \fIpanners\fR
instead, a panner is created in the lower right edge.  When the panner
is moved around, the window view follows the position of the panner.
See `\fBCUSTOMIZING @DDD@\fR', below, for details on how to set up
scroll bars or panners.
.PP
For fine-grain movements, selected displays may also be moved using
the arrow keys.  Pressing \fBShift\fR and an arrow key moves displays
by single pixels.  Pressing `\fBCtrl\fR' and arrow keys moves displays
by grid positions.

Edge hints can be selected and moved around like other displays.  If
an arc goes through the edge hint, you can change the shape of the arc
by moving the edge hint around.
.\"

You can enforce alignment by selecting `\fBOptions | Preferences |
Data Preferences | Auto-align displays on nearest grid point\fR'.  If
this feature is enabled, displays can be moved on grid positions only.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Layouting the Display Graph"
.\"
You can layout the entire graph as a tree by selecting `\fBData |

An interrupt (\fBCtrl+C\fR or \fBInterrupt\fR) does not exit from

command that is in progress and returns to the debugger command level.
It is safe to type the interrupt character at any time because the
debugger does not allow it to take effect until a time when it is
safe.
.PP
In case an ordinary interrupt does not succeed, you can also use an 
abort (\fBCtrl+\\\fR or \fBAbort\fR), which sends a \s-2QUIT\s+2 signal
to the inferior debugger.  Use this in emergencies only; the inferior
debugger may be left inconsistent after a \s-2QUIT\s+2 signal.

As a last resort\(em\&if \s-2@DDD@\s+2 hangs, for example\(em\&, you may

shell \s-2@DDD@\s+2 was started from, or by using the \s-2UNIX\s+2
`\fBkill\fR' command.  An interrupt signal interrupts any
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 action; the inferior debugger is interrupted as well.

It is possible to have the inferior debugger run on a remote

.PP
In order to run the inferior debugger on a remote host, you need
`\fBremsh\fR' (called `\fBrsh\fR' on \s-2BSD\s+2 systems) access on
the remote host.

.PP
There are a few \fIcaveats\fR in remote mode:
.IP \(bu 2
The remote debugger is started in your remote home directory.  Hence,
you must specify an absolute path name for \fIremote-program\fR (or a
path name relative to your remote home directory).  Same applies to
remote core files.  Also, be sure to specify a remote process id when
debugging a running program.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The remote debugger is started non-interactively.  Some \s-2DBX\s+2
versions have trouble with this.  If you don't get a prompt from the
remote debugger, use the `\fB\-\-rhost\fR' option instead of
`\fB\-\-host\fR'.  This will invoke the remote debugger via an
interactive shell on the remote host, which may lead to better
results.
.br
Note: using `\fB\-\-rhost\fR', \s-2@DDD@\s+2 invokes the inferior
debugger as soon as a shell prompt appears.  The first output on the
remote host ending in a space character or `\fB>\fR' and not followed
by a newline is assumed to be a shell prompt.  If necessary, adjust
your shell prompt on the remote host.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
To run the remote program, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 invokes an `\fBxterm\fR' terminal
emulator on the remote host, giving your current `\fBDISPLAY\fR'
environment variable as address.  If the remote host cannot invoke
`\fBxterm\fR', or does not have access to your X display, start
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 with the `\fB\-\-no\-exec\-window\fR' option.  The program
input/output will then go through the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 debugger console.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
In remote mode, all sources are loaded from the remote host; file
dialogs scan remote directories.  This may result in somewhat slower
operation than normal.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
To help you find problems due to remote execution, run \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with the

.SS "General Information"
.\"
To have \s-2@DDD@\s+2 run as an inferior debugger in other front-ends,
set up your debugger front-end such that `\fB@ddd@ \-\-tty\fR' is
invoked instead of the inferior debugger.  When \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is
invoked using the `\fB\-\-tty\fR' option, it enables its
\fI\s-2TTY\s+2 interface\fR, taking additional debugger commands from
standard input and forwarding debugger output to standard output, just
as if the inferior debugger had been invoked directly.  All remaining
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 functionality stays unchanged.
.PP
In case your debugger front-end uses the \s-2GDB\s+2
`\fB\-fullname\fR' option to have \s-2GDB\s+2 report source code
positions, the `\fB\-\-tty\fR' option is not required.  \s-2@DDD@\s+2
recognizes the `\fB\-fullname\fR' option, finds that it has been
invoked from a debugger front-end and automatically enables
the \s-2TTY\s+2 interface.
.PP
You may also invoke `\fB@ddd@ \-\-tty\fR' directly, entering
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 commands from your \s-2TTY\s+2, or use \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as
the end of a pipe, controlled by a remote program.  Be aware, however,
that the \s-2TTY\s+2 interface does not support line editing and
command completion and that \s-2@DDD@\s+2 exits as soon as it receives
a \s-2EOF\s+2 on its standard input.  Also, do not try to run
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 with \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as inferior debugger.
.PP
The `\fB\-\-tty\fR' option automatically disables the debugger
console, as its facilities are supposed to be provided by the

If your debugger allows you to define own command sequences, you can
also use these \fIuser-defined commands\fR within \s-2@DDD@\s+2; just
enter them at the debugger prompt.  However, you may encounter some
problems:
.IP \(bu 2
In contrast to the well-documented commands of the inferior debugger, 
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 does not know what your specific command does.  This may 
lead to inconsistencies between \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and the inferior
debugger.  For instance, if your own command `\fBbp\fR' sets a
breakpoint, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 may not display it immediately, because
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 does not know that `\fBbp\fR' changes the breakpoint
state.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot use \s-2@DDD@\s+2 \fBgraph\fR commands within user-defined
commands.  This is only natural, because user-defined commands are
interpreted by the inferior debugger, which does not know about
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 commands.
.PP
As a solution, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides a simple facility called
\fIauto-commands\fR.  If \s-2@DDD@\s+2 receives any output from the
inferior debugger in the form `\fB@ddd@: \fIcommand\fR', it will
interpret \fIcommand\fR as if it had been entered at the debugger
prompt.
.PP
Suppose you want to define a \s-2GDB\s+2 command `\fBdispfoo\fR' that
creates a data display containing the variable \fIfoo\fR.  All
\fBdispfoo\fR has to do is to issue a string
.br
.sp
  \fBddd: graph display foo\fR
.sp
.br
In \s-2GDB\s+2, this can be achieved using the \fBecho\fR command.  In 
your \fB$HOME/.gdbinit\fR file, insert the lines
.br
.sp
  \fBdefine dispfoo
    echo ddd: graph display foo
  end\fR
.sp
.br
Entering \fBdispfoo\fR will now have the same effect as entering
\fBgraph display foo\fR at the debugger prompt.
.PP
Unfortunately, auto-commands also raise a security problem, since
arbitrary commands can be executed.  Just imagine some malicuous
program issuing a string like `\fBddd: shell rm -fr $HOME\fR' when
being debugged!  Consequently, auto-commands are \fIdisabled\fR by
default and must be enabled explicitly.
.PP
To enable auto-commands, write in your `\fB$HOME/.dddinit\fR' file:
.br
.sp
  \fB@Ddd@*autoCommands: on\fR
.sp
.br
The default prefix of auto-commands is `\fBddd: \fR'.  You are
encouraged to change this value in your `\fB.dddinit\fR' file.  To use 
a prefix of, say, `\fBmagic123: \fR', write:
.br
.sp
  \fBDdd*autoCommandPrefix: magic123:\\ \fR
.sp
.br
Leave a space after the final `\fB\\\fR'.  Be sure to enable
auto-commands only if you have defined own commands; be sure to set up
an individual auto-command prefix to avoid security problems.

.TP
.B "buttonTips (\fPclass\fB Tips)"
Whether button tips are enabled (`\fBtrue\fR', default) or
not (`\fBfalse\fR').  Button tips are helpful for novices, but
may be distracting for experienced users.
.TP
.B "buttonDocs (\fPclass\fB Docs)"
Whether the display of button hints in the status line is enabled
(`\fBtrue\fR', default) or not (`\fBfalse\fR').
.TP
.B "globalTabCompletion (\fPclass\fB GlobalTabCompletion)"
If this is `\fBtrue\fR' (default), the \s-2\fBTAB\fR\s+2 key completes
arguments in all windows.  If this is `\fBfalse\fR', the
\s-2\fBTAB\fR\s+2 key completes arguments in the debugger console
only.
.TP
.B "groupIconify (\fPclass\fB GroupIconify)"
If this is `\fBtrue\fR', (de)iconifying any \s-2@DDD@\s+2 window
causes all other \s-2@DDD@\s+2 windows to (de)iconify as well.
Default is `\fBfalse\fR', meaning that each \s-2@DDD@\s+2 window can
be iconified on its own.
.TP
.B "saveHistoryOnExit (\fPclass\fB SaveHistoryOnExit)"
If `\fBtrue\fR' (default), the command history is automatically saved
when \s-2@DDD@\s+2 exits.  If the inferior debugger saves its
command history, its history file is used, otherwise,
`\fB$HOME/.ddd_history\fR' is used.
.TP
.B "suppressWarnings (\fPclass\fB SuppressWarnings)"
If `\fBtrue\fR', X warnings are suppressed.  This is
sometimes useful for executables that were built on a machine with a
different X or Motif configuration.  By default, this is
`\fBfalse\fR'.
.TP
.B "ungrabMousePointer (\fPclass\fB UngrabMousePointer)"
When debugging a modal X application, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 may interrupt it
while it has grabbed the pointer, making further interaction
impossible.  If this is `\fBtrue\fR' (default), \s-2@DDD@\s+2 will
check after each interaction whether the pointer is grabbed.  If this
is so, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 will instruct the debugged program to ungrab the
mouse pointer.
.TP
.B "valueTips (\fPclass\fB Tips)"
Whether value tips are enabled (`\fBtrue\fR', default) or not
(`\fBfalse\fR').  Value tips affect \s-2@DDD@\s+2 performance and may
be distracting for some experienced users.

makes \s-2@DDD@\s+2 run faster.
.TP
.B "cacheSourceFiles (\fPclass\fB CacheSourceFiles)"
Whether to cache source files (`\fBtrue\fR', default) or not
(`\fBfalse\fR').  Caching source files requires more memory, but makes
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 run faster.
.TP
.B "disassemble (\fPclass\fB Disassemble)"

their respective line number.  The default is `\fBfalse\fR'.
.TP
.B "findWordsOnly (\fPclass\fB FindWordsOnly)"
If this is `\fBtrue\fR' (default), the `\fBFind\fR' commands find
complete words only.  Otherwise, arbitrary occurrences are found.

The name of the button widget is built from the button specification.
First, trailing `\fB...\fR' and `\fB^\fR' specifications removed.
Then, any non-identifier character (letter, number, underscore) is
replaced by `\fB_\fR' (underscore).  Thus, the button specification
`\fBdisplay *()...\fR' results in a widget named `\fBdisplay____\fR'.
Unless a `\fBlabelString\fR' resource is specified, the capitalized
button specification is used as label.

.SH LIMITATIONS

.\"
.SS "Limitations using GDB"
.\"
Some \s-2GDB\s+2 settings are essential for \s-2@DDD@\s+2 to work correctly.
These settings with their correct values are:
.sp
.br
  \fBset height 0\fR
.br
  \fBset width 0\fR
.br
  \fBset print repeats 0\fR
.br
  \fBset verbose off\fR
.br
  \fBset prompt (gdb) \fR
.br
.sp
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 sets these values automatically when invoking \s-2GDB\s+2.
.PP
If these values are changed, there may be some malfunctions,
especially in the data display.  If you want to display C strings
(i.e., `\fBchar *\fR'-fields), it might be useful to change the
settings of `\fBprint repeats\fR' and `\fBprint elements\fR'.  But to
recognize array structures correctly, you should have `\fBprint
repeats\fR' set to 0.  Also, do not change the setting of `\fBprint
elements\fR' while there are array structures in the data display.
.PP
When debugging at the machine level with \s-2GDB\s+2 4.12 and earlier
as inferior debugger, use a `\fBdisplay /x $pc\fR' command to ensure
the program counter value is updated correctly at each stop.  You may
also enter the command in \fB$HOME/.gdbinit\fR or (better yet) upgrade
to the most recent \s-2GDB\s+2 version.
.PP
.\"
.SS "Limitations using DBX"
.\"
When used for debugging Modula-2 or Pascal programs, \s-2@DDD@\s+2
always numerates array elements starting with zero, instead of using
correct array subscripts.
.PP
With some \s-2DBX\s+2 versions (notably Solaris \s-2DBX\s+2),
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 strips C-style and C++-style comments from the
\s-2DBX\s+2 output in order to interpret it properly.  This also
affects the output of the debugged program when sent to the debugger
console.  Using the separate execution window avoids these problems.
.PP
In some \s-2DBX\s+2 versions (notably \s-2DEC\s+2 \s-2DBX\s+2 and
\s-2AIX\s+2 \s-2DBX\s+2), there is no automatic data display.
As an alternative, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 uses the `\fBprint\fR' command to
access data values.  This means that variable names are interpreted
according to the current frame; variables outside the current frame
cannot be displayed.
.\"
.SS "Limitations using XDB"
.\"
There is no automatic data display in \s-2XDB\s+2.  As a workaround,
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 uses the `\fBp\fR' command to access data values.  This
means that variable names are interpreted according to the current
frame; variables outside the current frame cannot be displayed.
.\"
.SS "General Limitations"
.\"
If command output is sent to the debugger console, it is impossible
for \s-2@DDD@\s+2 to distinguish between the output of the debugged
program and the output of the inferior debugger.  For instance, if
your program output includes debugger prompts or debugger-like output,
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 will likely become confused.  To avoid such problems,
use the separate execution window.
.PP
If the inferior debugger changes the default \s-2TTY\s+2 settings, for
instance through a `\fBstty\fR' command in its initialization file,
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 will likely become confused.  The same applies to
debugged programs which change the default \s-2TTY\s+2 settings.

.SS "How to Report Bugs"
.\"
Here are some guidelines for bug reports:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
\fIreport all the facts\fR.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known.  It is not very important what happens
if the bug is already known.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug is not known.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Your bug report should be self-contained.  Do not refer to information
sent in previous mails; your previous mail may have been forwarded to
somebody else.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Please report each bug in a separate message.  This makes it easier
for us to track which bugs have been fixed and to forward your bugs
reports to the appropriate maintainer.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Please report bugs in English; this increases the chances of finding
someone who can fix the bug.  Do not assume one particular person will
receive your bug report.
.br
.PP
.\"
.SS "What to Include in a Bug Report"
.\"
To enable us to fix a \s-2@DDD@\s+2 bug, you \fImust\fR include the
following information:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Your \s-2@DDD@\s+2 configuration.  Invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as
.br
.sp
  \fB@ddd@ \-\-configuration\fR
.sp
.br
to get the configuration information.  If this does not work, please
include at least the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 version, the type of machine you
are using, and its operating system name and version number.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The debugger you are using and its version (e.g., `\fBgdb-4.16\fR' or
`\fBdbx as shipped with Solaris 2.5\fR').
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The compiler you used to compile \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and its version (e.g.,
`\fBgcc-2.8.0\fR').
.br
.IP \(bu 2
A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, \*(lq\s-2@DDD@\s+2 gets a fatal signal\*(rq or
\*(lq\s-2@DDD@\s+2 exits immediately after attempting to create the data
window\*(lq.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
If possible, include a \fIdialog trace\fR showing the interaction
between \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and the inferior debugger.  Such a dialog
trace is created by invoking \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with the `\fB\-\-trace\fR'
option.  Include all trace output from the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 invocation up
to the first bug occurrence.

diffs.  If you even discuss something in the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 source, refer to

.SH HISTORY
.\" ---------------
The history of \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is a story of code recycling.  The oldest
parts of \s-2@DDD@\s+2 were written in 1990, when \fIAndreas Zeller\fR
designed \s-2VSL\s+2, a box-based visual structure language for
visualizing data and program structures.  The \s-2VSL\s+2 interpreter
and the \s-2BOX\s+2 library became part of Andreas' Diploma Thesis, a
graphical syntax editor based on the Programming System Generator
\s-2PSG\s+2.
.PP
In 1992, the \s-2VSL\s+2 and Box libraries were recycled for the
\s-2NORA\s+2 project.  For \s-2NORA\s+2, an experimental
inference-based software development tool set, Andreas wrote a graph
editor (based on \s-2VSL\s+2 and the \s-2BOX\s+2 libraries) and
facilities for inter-process knowledge exchange.  Based on these
tools, \fIDorothea Ltkehaus\fR realized \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as her Diploma
Thesis, 1994.
.PP
The original \s-2@DDD@\s+2 had no source window; this was added by
Dorothea during the winter of 1994/1995.  In the first quarter of
1995, finally, Andreas completed \s-2@DDD@\s+2 by adding command and
execution windows, extensions for \s-2DBX\s+2 and remote debugging as
well as configuration support for several architectures.  Since then,
many people have contributed to the success of \s-2@DDD@\s+2; see the
file `\fBCONTRIBUTORS\fR' in the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 distribution for
