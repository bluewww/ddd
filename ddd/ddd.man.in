.\" ---------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ---------------
The purpose of a debugger such as \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is to allow you to see
what is going on \*(lqinside\*(rq another program while it
executes\(em\&or what another program was doing at the moment it
crashed.

\s-2@DDD@\s+2 can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
.IP \(bu 2
Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
behavior.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Make your program stop on specified conditions.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
.PP
.\"
\*(lqClassical\*(rq \s-2UNIX\s+2 debuggers such as the \s-2GNU\s+2
debugger (\s-2GDB\s+2) provide a command-line interface and a
multitude of commands for these and other debugging purposes.
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 is a \fIwrapper\fR around an inferior \s-2GDB\s+2 or
\s-2DBX\s+2 debugger.  In addition to the \s-2GDB\s+2 or \s-2DBX\s+2
command-line interface, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides a \fIgraphical user
interface\fR to support common debugging tasks.  The \s-2@DDD@\s+2
\fIgraphical data display\fR allows for interactive exploration of
data structures.
.PP

.\" ---------------
.SH "INVOKING @DDD@"
.\" ---------------
.\"
You can run \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with no arguments or options.  However, the
most usual way to start \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is with one argument or two,
specifying an executable program as the argument:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\ core\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want
to debug a running process:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\ 1234\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
would attach \s-2@DDD@\s+2 to process \c
.B 1234\c
\& (unless you also have a file
named `\|\c
.B 1234\c
\&\|'; \s-2@DDD@\s+2 does check for a core file first).
.\"
.PP
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 uses \s-2GDB\s+2 as inferior debugger.  Use
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-dbx program\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
to run \s-2DBX\s+2 as inferior debugger for the program.
.PP
To learn more about \s-2@DDD@\s+2 options, run
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-help\fR
.br
.sp
to get a list of frequently used options, or see the `\fBOPTIONS\fR'
section, below.

.\" ---------------
.SH "GETTING HELP"
.\" ---------------
.\"
You can get help on any visible \s-2@DDD@\s+2 item by pressing the
`\fBF1\fR' key and moving the question mark arrow on the item you
want help for.  Clicking on the item pops up a help text.
.PP
You can get help on \s-2GDB\s+2 and \s-2DBX\s+2 commands by entering
the `\fBhelp\fR' command at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' or `\fB(dbx)\fR' prompt
(see next section).

.\" ---------------
.SH "ENTERING COMMANDS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
In the \fIcommand window\fR, you can interact with the \s-2GDB\s+2 or
\s-2DBX\s+2 command interface.  Enter \s-2GDB\s+2 commands at the
`\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt, and \s-2DBX\s+2 commands at the `\fB(dbx)\fR'
prompt.  Arbitrary \s-2GDB\s+2 and \s-2DBX\s+2 commands can be used.
.PP
You can \fIrepeat\fR previous and next commands by pressing the
`\fBUp\fR' and `\fBDown\fR' keys, respectively.  If you enter an empty
line, the last command is repeated as well.  The `\fBCommand
History...\fR' item in the `\fBCommands...\fR' menu shows the command
history.
.PP
Using \s-2GDB\s+2, you can \fIcomplete\fR commands and arguments by
pressing the \s-2\fBTAB\fR\s+2 key; pressing the \s-2\fBTAB\fR\s+2 key
multiple times shows one possible expansion after the other.
.PP
Here are some of the most frequently needed debugger commands:
.TP
.B break \fR[\|\fIfile\fB:\fR\|]\fIfunction
\&
(\s-2GDB\s+2 only) Set a breakpoint at \c
.I function\c
\& (in \c
.I file\c
\&).
.TP
.B stop in \fIfunction
\&
(\s-2DBX\s+2 only) Set a breakpoint at \c
.I function.
.TP
.B run \fR[\|\fIarglist\fR\|]
Start your program (with \c
.I arglist\c
\&, if specified).
.TP
.B where
Display the program stack.
.TP
.BI print " expr"\c
\&
Display the value of an expression.
.TP
.B cont
Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g. at a breakpoint).
.TP
.B next
Execute next program line (after stopping); step \c
.I over\c
\& any
function calls in the line.
.TP
.B step
Execute next program line (after stopping); step \c
.I into\c
\& any
function calls in the line.
.TP
.B help \fR[\|\fIname\fR\|]
Show information about the command \c
.I name\c
\&, or general usage information.
.TP
.B quit
Exit \s-2@DDD@\s+2.
.PP
For full details on \s-2GDB\s+2 commands, see \c
.I 
Using \s-2GDB\s+2: A Guide to the \s-2GNU\s+2 Source-Level Debugger\c
\&, by Richard M. Stallman and Roland H. Pesch.  
The same text is available online as the \c
.B gdb\c
\& entry in the \c
.B info\c
\& program.
.PP
For full details on \s-2DBX\s+2 commands, see the \s-2DBX\s+2 documentation.

.\" ---------------
.SH "OPENING FILES"
.\" ---------------
.\"
If you did not invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2 specifying a program to be debugged,
you can use the `\fBFile\fR' menu to open programs, core dumps and
sources.
.PP
To open a program to be debugged, select `\fBOpen Program\fR' from the
`\fBFile\fR' menu.
.PP
To open a core dump for the program, select `\fBOpen Core\fR' from the
`\fBFile\fR' menu.
.PP
To open an arbitrary source file, select `\fBOpen Source\fR' from the
`\fBFile\fR' menu.

.\" ---------------
.SH "BREAKPOINTS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
If the source of the debugged program is available, the \fIsource
window\fR displays its current source text.  (If a source text cannot
be found, use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBdirectory\fR' command to specify
source text directories).
.PP
Using the source window, you can make the program stop at certain
\fIbreakpoints\fR and trace its execution.
.\"
.SS "Setting Breakpoints by Location"
.\"
If the source line is visible, click with the \fIleft mouse button\fR
on the source line number and then on the `\fBBreak()\fR' button.
.PP
As an alternative, you can simply press the \fIright mouse button\fR
on the source line number and select the `\fBSet Breakpoint\fR' item
from the popup menu.
.PP
As another alternative, you can enter the line number in the argument
field (indicated by `\fB():\fR') and click on the `\fBBreak()\fR'
button.
.PP
As yet another alternative, you can select `\fBEdit Breakpoints...\fR'
in the `\fBSource\fR' menu, click on the `\fBNew\fR' button and enter
the line number.
.PP
And finally, you can also use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBbreak\fR' command or
the \s-2DBX\s+2 `\fBstop\fR' command.  Type `\fBhelp break\fR' at the
`\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt (or `\fBhelp stop\fR' at the `\fB(dbx)\fR'
prompt) for details.
.PP
(If you find this number of alternatives confusing, be aware that
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 users fall into three categories, which must all be
supported.  \fINovice users\fR explore \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and may prefer to
use one single mouse button.  \fIAdvanced users\fR know how to use
shortcuts and prefer popup menus.  \fIExperienced \s-2GDB\s+2 and
\s-2DBX\s+2 users\fR prefer the command line interface.)
.PP
Breakpoints are indicated by a plain stop sign, 
or as `\fB#\fIn\fB#\fR', where \fIn\fR is the breakpoint number.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Setting Breakpoints by Name"
.\"
If the function name is visible, click with the \fIleft
mouse button\fR' on the function name.  The function name is copied to
the argument field.  Click on the `\fBBreak()\fR' button to set a
breakpoint there.
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press the \fIright
mouse button\fR on the function name and select the `\fBbreak\fR' item
from the popup menu.
.PP
As another alternative, you can enter the function name in the
argument field (possibly using name completion by pressing the
`\fBTab\fR' key) and click on the `\fBBreak()\fR' button.
.PP
As yet another alternative, you can click on `\fBNew\fR' from the
Breakpoint editor (invoked through `\fBEdit Breakpoints...\fR'
in the `\fBSource\fR' menu) and enter the function name.
.PP
Finally, you can use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBbreak\fR' command or the
\s-2DBX\s+2 `\fBstop\fR' command.  Type `\fBhelp break\fR' at the
`\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt (or `\fBhelp stop\fR' at the `\fB(dbx)\fR'
prompt) for details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Disabling and Enabling Breakpoints"
.\"
Note: \s-2DBX\s+2 does not support breakpoint disabling.
.PP
Press the \fIright mouse button\fR on the breakpoint name and select
the `\fBDisable Breakpoint\fR' item (or the `\fBEnable Breakpoint\fR'
item, respectively) from the popup menu.
.PP
As an alternative, you can select the breakpoint and click on
`\fBDisable\fR' or `\fBEnable\fR' in the Breakpoint editor (invoked
through `\fBEdit Breakpoints...\fR' in the `\fBSource\fR' menu).
.PP
Disabled breakpoints are indicated by a grey stop sign, or 
`\fB_\fIn\fB_\fR', where \fIn\fR is the breakpoint number.
.PP
Finally, you can use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBdisable\fR' command.  Type
`\fBhelp disable\fR' at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt for details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Temporary Breakpoints"
.\"
A \fItemporary breakpoint\fR is immediately deleted as soon as it is
reached.  To set a temporary breakpoint,  press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the source line number and select the `\fBSet Temporary
Breakpoint\fR' item from the popup menu.
.PP
Temporary breakpoints are convenient to make the program continue up
to a specific location: just set the temporary breakpoint at this
location and continue execution.
.PP
The `\fBContinue Until Here\fR' item from the popup menu sets
a temporary breakpoint on the source line number and immediately
continues execution.  In \s-2GDB\s+2, execution stops when a source
line greater than the source line is reached, or when the current
stack frame is exited.  In \s-2DBX\s+2, execution stops when the
temporary breakpoint is reached.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Deleting Breakpoints"
If the breakpoint is visible, click with the \fIleft mouse button\fR
on the breakpoint.  The breakpoint location is copied to the argument
field.  Click on the `\fBClear()\fR' button to delete all breakpoints
there.
.PP
If the function name is visible, click with the \fIleft mouse
button\fR on the function name.  The function name is copied to the
argument field.  Click on the `\fBClear()\fR' button to set a breakpoint
there.
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the function name and select the `\fBclear\fR' item from
the popup menu.
.PP
As yet another alternative, you can select the breakpoint and click on
`\fBDelete\fR' from the Breakpoint editor (invoked through `\fBEdit
Breakpoints...\fR' in the `\fBSource\fR' menu).
.PP
Finally, you can use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBclear\fR' and `\fBdelete\fR'
commands.  Type `\fBhelp clear\fR' or `\fBhelp delete\fR' at
the `\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt for details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "More Breakpoint Features"
Using the Breakpoint editor (invoked through `\fBEdit
Breakpoints...\fR' in the `\fBSource\fR' menu), you can specify
breakpoint conditions and ignore counts.  Click on the
`\fBCondition...\fR' and `\fBIgnore Count...\fR' buttons and click on
the `\fBHelp\fR' button.
.PP
More breakpoint features can be invoked through the command window.
Enter `\fBhelp breakpoints\fR' at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt.

.\" ---------------
.SH "LOOKING UP ITEMS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.SS "Searching Definitions"
.\"
If you wish to lookup a specific function or variable definition whose
name is visible in the source text, click with the \fIleft mouse
button\fR on the function or variable name.  The name is copied to the
argument field.  Click on the `\fBLookup()\fR' button to find its
definition.
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the function name and select the `\fBlookup\fR' item from
the popup menu.
.PP
As another alternative, you can enter the function name in the
argument field and click on the `\fBLookup()\fR' button to find its
definition.
.PP
Finally, you can use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBinfo line\fR' command.
Type `\fBhelp info line\fR' at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt for
details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Searching Items in the Source Text"
.\"
If the item you wish to search is visible in the source text, click
with the \fIleft mouse button\fR on it.  The identifier is copied to
the argument field.  Click on the `\fBFind>>()\fR' button to find
following occurrences and on the  `\fBFind<<()\fR' button to find
previous occurrences.
.PP
As an alternative, you can enter the item in the argument field and
click on one of the `\fBFind\fR' buttons.
.PP
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 finds only complete words.  To search for
arbitrary substrings, change the value of the `\fBFind Words Only\fR'
option in the `\fBSource Options\fR' menu.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Finding Breakpoints"
.\"
If you wish to lookup a specific breakpoint, select the
`\fBLookup\fR' item from the `\fBBreakpoints\fR' menu.  After
selecting a breakpoint from the list and clicking the
`\fBLookup\fR' button, the breakpoint location is displayed.
.PP
As an alternative, you can enter `\fB#\fIn\fR' in the argument field,
where \fIn\fR is the breakpoint number and click on the `\fBLookup()\fR'
button to find its definition.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Looking up Previous Locations"
.\"
Use the `\fBBack\fR' and `\fBForward\fR' buttons to lookup previous or
next looked-up locations.  The location found is underlined.

.\" ---------------
.SH "RUNNING THE PROGRAM"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.SS "Starting Program Execution"
.\"
Select `\fBRun\fR' from the `\fBProgram\fR' menu to start execution of
the debugged program.  You will then be prompted for the arguments to
give to your program.  You can either select from a list of previously
used arguments or enter own arguments in the text field.  Afterwards,
press the `\fBOK\fR' button to start execution with the selected
arguments.
.PP
To run your program again, with the same arguments, select `\fBRun
Again\fR' from the `\fBProgram\fR' menu or press the `\fBRun\fR'
button below.  You may also enter `\fBrun\fR', followed by arguments
at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' or `\fB(dbx)\fR' prompt instead.
.PP
When the program is first started, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 invokes an \fIexecution
window\fR, where the program terminal input and output is shown.  (You
can disable this feature by starting \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with the
`\fB\-\-no\-exec\-window\fR' option.)
.\"
.\"
.SS "Stopping the Program"
.\"
The program stops as soon as a breakpoint is reached.  The current
execution position is highlighted by an arrow.
.PP
You can interrupt a running program any time by clicking the
`\fBInterrupt\fR' button or typing \fBCtrl+C\fR in a \s-2@DDD@\s+2 window.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Resuming Execution"
.\"
To resume execution, at the address where your program last stopped,
click on the `\fBContinue\|\fR` button.  Any breakpoints set at that
address are bypassed.
.PP
To execute just one source line, click on the `\fBStep\fR' button.
The program is executed until control reaches a different source line,
which may be in a different function.
.PP
To continue to the next line in the current function, click on the
`\fBNext\fR' button.  This is similar to `\fBStep\fR', but any
function calls appearing within the line of code are executed without
stopping.
.PP
To continue running until the current function returns, use the
`\fBFinish\fR' button.  The returned value (if any) is printed.
.PP
To continue running until a line after the current source line is
reached, use the `\fBContinue Until Here\fR' facility from the line
popup menu.  See `\fBTemporary Breakpoints\fR', above, for a
discussion.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Examining the Stack"
.\"
When your program has stopped, the first thing you need to know is
where it stopped and how it got there.
.PP
The `\fBUp\fR' button selects the function that called the current
one.
.PP
The `\fBDown\fR' button selects the function that was called by
the current one.
.PP
You can also type the \s-2GDB\s+2 and \s-2DBX\s+2 `\fBup\fR' and
`\fBdown\fR' commands at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' or `\fB(dbx)\fR' prompt.

.\" ---------------
.SH "EXAMINING DATA"
.\" ---------------
.\"
In \s-2@DDD@\s+2, the usual way to examine data is using the \fIgraphical data
display\fR in the \fIdata window\fR.  The data window holds
\fIdisplays\fR showing names and the values of variables.  The display
is updated each time the program stops.
.\"
.SS "Displaying Variable Values"
To create a new display, select the variable by clicking the \fIleft mouse
button\fR on its name.  The variable name is copied to the argument
field.  By clicking the `\fBDisplay()\fR' button, a new display is
created in the data window.
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the variable name and select the `\fBdisplay\fR' item from
the popup menu.
.PP
As another alternative, you may also enter the variable name in the
argument field and press the `\fBDisplay()\fR' button.
.PP
If the data window is visible, you may invoke the `\fBEdit
Displays...\fR' item from the `\fBData\fR' menu and click on the
`\fBNew...\fR' button.  Enter the variable name in the resulting
prompt dialog.
.PP
Finally, you may enter
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display \fI expr\fR
.sp
.br
\&at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' or `\fB(dbx)\fR' prompt.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Selecting Displays"
.\"
Each display in the data window has a \fItitle bar\fR containing the
\fIdisplay number\fR and the displayed expression (the \fIdisplay
name\fR).  Below the title, the \fIdisplay value\fR is shown.
.PP
You can select individual displays by clicking on them with the
\fIleft mouse button\fR.  The resulting expression is shown in the
\fIargument field\fR, below.
.PP
You can \fIextend\fR an existing selection by pressing the \fBShift\fI
Key while selecting.
.PP
Single displays may also be selected by using the arrow keys.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Selecting Multiple Displays"
.\"
Multiple displays are selected by pressing and holding the \fIleft
mouse button\fR somewhere on the window background.  By moving the
pointer while holding the button, a selection rectangle is shown; all
displays fitting in the rectangle are selected when the mouse button
is released.
.PP
By double-clicking on a display, the display itself and all connected
displays are automatically selected.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Selecting Display Parts"
.\"
If a display is composed from several values (that is, a C/C++
\fIclass\fR, \fIstruct\fR, \fIunion\fR, or \fIarray\fR; or a
\s-2PASCAL\s+2/\s-2MODULA-2\s+2 \fIRECORD\fR or \fIARRAY\fR), you can
select individual parts by clicking on their names or values.  The
resulting expression is shown in the \fIargument field\fR, below.
.PP
Selection of multiple display parts is not supported.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Manipulating Aggregate Values"
.\"
\fIAggregate Values\fR can be shown \fIexpanded\fR, that is,
displaying all details, or \fIhidden\fR, that is, displayed as
`\fB{...}\fR'.
.PP
To show details about an aggregate, select the aggregate by clicking
the \fIleft mouse button\fR on its name or value and click on the
`\fBShow()\fR' button.
.PP
To hide details about an aggregate, select the aggregate by clicking
the \fIleft mouse button\fR on its name or value and click on the
`\fBHide()\fR' button.
.PP
As a faster alternative, you can also press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the aggregate and select the appropriate menu item.
.PP
Arrays can be aligned horizontally or vertically.  To change the
alignment of an array, select it and then click on the `\fBRotate()\fR'
button.
.PP
As a faster alternative, you can also press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the array and select the `\fBRotate\fR' menu item.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Displaying Dependent Values"
.\"
Dependent displays are created from an existing display.  The
dependency is indicated by arrows leading from the originating display
to the dependent display.
.PP
To create a dependent display, select the originating display or

Since so many data structures are realized using pointers,
there is a shortcut for creating dependent displays showing the value
of a dereferenced pointer.
.PP
To dereference a pointer, select the originating pointer value or name
and click on the `\fBDereference()\fR' button.  A new display showing
the dereferenced pointer value is created.

.SS "Displaying Multiple Array Items"
.\"
When debugging C or C++ programs, one often has to deal with pointers
to arrays of dynamically determined size.  Both \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and
\s-2GDB\s+2 provide special support for such dynamic arrays.
.PP
To display several successive objects of the same type (a section of
an array, or an array of dynamically determined size), use the
notation \fB[\fIFROM\fB..\fITO\fB]\fR in display expressions.
\fIFROM\fR and \fITO\fR denote the first and last array position to
display.  Thus,
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display argv[0..9]\fR
.sp
.br
creates ten new display nodes for `\fBargv[0]\fR',
`\fBargv[1]\fR', ..., `\fBargv[9]\fR'.
.PP
As an alternative, you can use \s-2GDB\s+2 \fIartificial arrays\fR.
Typing
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display argv[0] @ 10\fR
.sp
.br
creates a single array display node containing `\fBargv[0]\fR' up to
`\fBargv[9]\fR'.  Generally, by using the `\fB@\fR' operator, you
can specify the number of array elements to be displayed.
.PP
For more details on artificial arrays, see the \s-2GDB\s+2 documentation.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Deleting Displays"
.\"
To delete a single display, select it and click on the `\fBDelete()\fR'
button.  As an alternative, you can also press the \fIright mouse
button\fR on the display and select the `\fBDelete Display\fR' item.
.PP
When a display is deleted, its immediate ancestors and descendants are
automatically selected, so that you can easily delete entire graphs.
.PP
To delete several displays at once, select the `\fBDelete...\fR' item
in the Display Editor (invoked through the `\fBEdit Displays...\fR'
item in the `\fBData\fR' menu).  Select any number of display items in
the usual way and delete them by pressing `\fBDelete\fR'.
.PP
As an alternative, you can also type
.sp
.br
  \fBundisplay \fINUM...\fR
.sp
.br
at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' or `\fB(dbx)\fR' prompt, where \fINUM...\fR is a
space-separated list of the displays to delete.  You may need to
refresh the data window afterwards (see below).
.\"
.\"
.SS "Disabling or Enabling Displays"
.\"
Note: \s-2DBX\s+2 does not support display disabling.
.PP
Unlike a \fIdeleted\fR display item, a \fIdisabled\fR display item
remains in the display, but its value is not shown until it is enabled
again.
.PP
Displays are enabled and disabled the same way they are deleted, using
the `\fBDisable()\fR'/`\fBEnable()\fR' button, the
`\fBDisable\fR'/`\fBEnable Display\fR' popup menu item, or the
`\fBDisable\fR'/`\fBEnable\fR' buttons in the Display Editor.

Although the data window refreshes itself automatically each time the
program stops, there are some situations where you should refresh it
explicitly.
.PP
The data window should be refreshed whenever:

.SH "GRAPH EDITING"
.\" ---------------
.\"
The \s-2@DDD@\s+2 data window offers some basic functionality to
manipulate the display graph.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Moving Displays Around"
.\"
From time to time, you may wish to move displays at another place in
the data window.  You can move a single display by pressing and
holding the \fIleft mouse button\fR on the display title.  Moving the
pointer while holding the button causes all selected displays to move
along with the pointer.
.PP
If the data window becomes too small to hold all displays, scroll bars
are created.  If your \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is set up to use \fIpanners\fR
instead, a panner is created in the lower right edge.  When the panner
is moved around, the window view follows the position of the panner.
See `\fBCUSTOMIZING @DDD@\fR', below, for details on how to set up
scroll bars or panners.
.PP
For fine-grain movements, selected displays may also be moved using
the arrow keys.  Pressing \fBShift\fR and an arrow key moves displays
by single pixels.  Pressing \fRCtrl\fB and arrow keys moves displays
by grid positions.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Aligning Displays"
.\"
You can align all displays on the nearest grid position by selecting
`\fBAlign Displays\fR' from the `\fBGraph\fR' menu.  This is useful
for keeping edges horizontal or vertical.
.PP
You can enforce alignment by selecting `\fBSnap to Grid\fR' in the
`\fBData Options\fR' menu.  If `\fBSnap to Grid\fR' is
enabled, displays can be moved on grid positions only.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Layouting the Display Graph"
.\"
You can layout the entire graph as a tree by selecting `\fBLayout
Graph\fR' from the `\fBData\fR' menu.
.PP
Layouting the graph may introduce \fIedge hints\fR; that is, edges are
no more straight lines, but lead to an edge hint and from there to
their destination.  You can make edge hints visible by selecting
`\fBShow Edge Hints\fR' in the `\fBData Options\fR' menu.
Edge hints can be moved around like arbitrary displays.
.PP
To enable a more compact layout, you can set the `\fBCompact
Layout\fR' option in the `\fBData Options\fR' menu.  This realizes an
alternate layout algorithm, where successors are placed next to their
parents.  This algorithm is suitable for homogeneous data structures
only.
.PP
You can enforce layout by setting the `\fBAutomatic Layout\fR' option
in the `\fBData Options\fR' menu.  If `\fBAutomatic Layout\fR' is
enabled, the graph is layouted after each change.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Rotating the Display Graph"
.\"
You can rotate the entire graph clockwise by 90 degrees by selecting
`\fBRotate Graph\fR' from the `\fBData\fR' menu.
.PP
If the graph was previously layouted, you may need to layout it again.
Subsequent layouts will respect the direction of the last rotation.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Printing the Display Graph"
.\"
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 allows for printing the graph picture on PostScript
printers, which is useful for documenting program states.
.PP
To print the graph on a PostScript printer, select the `\fBPrint
Graph...\fR' item from the `\fBFile\fR' menu.  Enter the printing
command in the `\fBPrinter Command\fR' field.  Click on the
`\fBPrint\fR' button to start printing.
.PP
To re-print the display graph using the previous settings, select the
`\fBQuick Print\fR' item from the `\fBFile\fR' menu.
.PP
As an alternative, you may also print the graph in a file.  Click on
the `\fBFile\fR' button and enter the file name in the `\fBFile
Name\fR' field.  Click on the `\fBPrint\fR' button to create the file.
.PP
When the graph is printed in a file, two formats are available:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
PostScript - suitable for enclosing it in another document;
.br
.IP \(bu 2
\s-2XFIG\s+2 - suitable for editing, using the \s-2XFIG\s+2 graphic

.SH "MACHINE-LEVEL DEBUGGING"
.\" ---------------
.\"
Note: Machine-level support is not available with \s-2DBX\s+2.
.PP
Sometimes, it is desirable to examine a program not only at the
source level, but also at the machine level.  \s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides
special machine code and register windows for this task.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Examining Machine Code"
To enable machine-level support, select `\fBDisplay Machine Code\fR'
from the `\fBSource Options\fR' menu.  With `\fBDisplay Machine
Code\fR' enabled, an additional \fImachine code window\fR shows up,
displaying the machine code of the current function.  By moving the
sash at the right of the separating line between source and machine
code, you can resize the source and machine code windows.
.PP
The machine code window works very much like the source window.  You
can set, clear, and change breakpoints by selecting the address and
pressing a `\fBBreak()\fR' or `\fBClear()\fR' button; the usual
popup menus are also available.  Breakpoints and the current
execution position are displayed simultaneously in both source and
machine code.
.PP
The `\fBLookup()\fR' button can be used to look up the machine code
for a specific function\(em\&or the function for a specific address.
Just click on the location in one window and press `\fBLookup()\fR'
to see the corresponding code in the other window.
.PP
If source code is not available, only the machine code window is
updated.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Execution"
All execution facilities available in the source code window are
available in the machine code window as well.  Two special facilities
are convenient for machine-level debugging:
.PP
To execute just one machine instruction, click on the `\fBStepi\fR' button.
.PP
To continue to the next instruction in the current function, click on
the `\fBNexti\fR' button.  This is similar to `\fBStepi\fR', but any
subroutine calls are executed without stopping.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Registers"
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides a \fIregister window\fR showing the machine
register values after each program stop.  To enable the register
window, select `\fBShow Registers\fR' from the `\fBStack\fR' menu.
.PP
By selecting one of the registers, its name is copied to the argument
field.  You can use it as value for `\fBDisplay()\fR', for instance,
to have its value displayed in the data window.


.\" ---------------------
.SH "EDITING SOURCE CODE"
.\" ---------------------
.\"
In \s-2@DDD@\s+2 itself, you cannot change the source file currently
displayed.  \s-2@DDD@\s+2 allows you to invoke a \fItext editor\fR
instead.  To invoke a text editor for the current source file, select
the `\fBEdit\fR' button or the `\fBEdit Source...\fR' item from the
`\fBSource\fR' menu.
.PP
The editor command is specified in the `\fBeditCommand\fR' resource.
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 tries to invoke the first available editor
from the following list:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The editor specified in the `\fBXEDITOR\fR' environment variable;
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The `\fBgnuclient\fR' program, invoking a separate window from a running
\fBEmacs\fR editor;
.br
.IP \(bu 2

`\fBEDITOR\fR' environment variable;
.br
.IP \(bu 2
A `\fBxterm\fR' terminal emulator running the `\fBvi\fR' editor.
.PP
After the editor has exited, the source code shown is automatically
brought up-to-date.
.PP
If you have \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and an editor running in parallel, you can
also update the source code manually by selecting the `\fBReload
Source...\fR' item from the `\fBSource\fR' menu.  This reloads the
source code shown from the source file.  As \s-2@DDD@\s+2
automatically reloads the source code if the debugged program has been
recompiled, this should seldom be necessary.


.\" ---------------
.SH "QUITTING @DDD@"

To exit \s-2@DDD@\s+2, select `\fBExit\fR' from the `\fBFile\fR' menu.
You may also type the `\fBquit\fR' command at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' or
`\fB(dbx)\fR' prompt.  \s-2GDB\s+2 also accepts the `\fBq\fR' command
or an end-of-file character (usually \fBCtrl+D\fR).
.PP
An interrupt (\fBCtrl+C\fR) does not exit from \s-2@DDD@\s+2, but rather
terminates the action of any \s-2GDB\s+2 or \s-2DBX\s+2 command that
is in progress and returns to the debugger command level.  It is safe
to type the interrupt character at any time because the debugger does
not allow it to take effect until a time when it is safe.
.PP
You may also interrupt \s-2@DDD@\s+2 using an interrupt signal
(\s-2SIGINT\s+2)\(em\&for instance by pressing \fBCtrl+C\fR in the shell
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 was started from, or by using the \s-2UNIX\s+2
`\fBkill\fR' command.  This interrupts any \s-2@DDD@\s+2 action; the
inferior \s-2GDB\s+2 or \s-2DBX\s+2 debugger is interrupted as well.

There are a few \fIcaveats\fR in remote mode:
.IP \(bu 2
The remote debugger is started in your remote home directory.  Hence,
you must specify an absolute path name for \fIremote-program\fR (or a

remote core files.  Also, be sure to specify a remote process id when
debugging a running program.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
To run the remote program, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 invokes an `\fBxterm\fR' terminal
emulator on the remote host, giving your current `\fBDISPLAY\fR'
environment variable as address.  If the remote host cannot invoke
`\fBxterm\fR', or does not have access to your X display, start
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 with the `\fB\-\-no\-exec\-window\fR' option.  The program
input/output will then go through the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 command window.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
In remote mode, all sources are loaded from the remote host; file
dialogs scan remote directories.  This may result in somewhat slower
operation than normal.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
To help you find problems due to remote execution, run \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with the

To have \s-2@DDD@\s+2 run as an inferior debugger in other front-ends,
set up your debugger front-end such that `\fB@ddd@ \-\-tty\fR'
is invoked instead of \s-2GDB\s+2 resp. \s-2DBX\s+2.  When
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 is invoked using the `\fB\-\-tty\fR' option, it enables

.\"
You can use the following options when starting \s-2@DDD@\s+2.  All
options may be abbreviated, as long as they are unambiguous; single
dashes may also be used.  Options not listed here are passed to the
inferior debugger.

.TP
.B \-\-attach\-windows
Attach the source and data windows to the command window, creating one
single big \s-2@DDD@\s+2 window.  This gives the good ole
`\fBxxgdb\fR' or `\fBxdbx\fR' feeling.
.TP
.B \-\-attach\-source\-window
Attaches only the source window to the command window.
.TP
.B \-\-attach\-data\-window
Attaches only the source window to the command window.
.TP
.B \-\-configuration
Show the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 configuration settings and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-check-configuration
Check the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 environment (in particular, the X configuration),
report any possible problem causes and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-dbx
Run the \s-2DBX\s+2 debugger as inferior debugger.
.TP
.B \-\-debugger \fIname\fR
Invoke the inferior debugger \fIname\fR.  This is useful if you have
several debugger versions around, or if \s-2GDB\s+2 and \s-2DBX\s+2
cannot be invoked as `\fBgdb\fR' or `\fBdbx\fR', respectively.
.TP
.B \-\-exec\-window
Run the debugged program in a specially created execution window.
This is useful for programs that have special terminal requirements
not provided by the debugger window, as raw keyboard processing or
terminal control sequences.
.TP
.B \-\-fullname
Enable \s-2TTY\s+2 interface, taking additional debugger commands
from standard input and forwarding debugger output on standard output.
Current positions are issued in \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fB\-fullname\fR' format
suitable for debugger front-ends.
.TP
.B \-\-gdb
Run the \s-2GDB\s+2 debugger as inferior debugger.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Give a list of frequently used options.  Show options of the
inferior debugger as well.
.TP
.B \-\-host \fIhostname\fR
Run the inferior debugger on the remote host \fIhostname\fR.  See
\fBREMOTE MODE\fR, above.
.TP
.B \-\-login \fIusername\fR
Use \fIusername\fR as remote user name.  See \fBREMOTE MODE\fR, above.
.TP
.B \-\-manual
Show this manual page and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-exec\-window
Do not run the debugged program in a specially created execution
window; use the command window instead.  Useful for programs that have
little terminal input/output, or for remote debugging.
.TP
.B \-\-nw
Do not use the X window interface.  Start the inferior debugger on
the local host.
.TP
.B \-\-panned\-graph
Use an Athena panner to scroll the data window.  Most people prefer
panners on scroll bars, since panners allow two-dimensional scrolling.
However, the panner is off by default, since some Motif
implementations do not work well with Athena widgets.  See also
\fB\-\-scrolled\-graph\fR, below.
.TP
.B \-\-separate\-windows
Separate the command, source and data windows.  This is the default.
See also the `\fB\-\-attach\fR' options, above.
.TP
.B \-\-scrolled\-graph
Use Motif scroll bars to scroll the data window.  This is the default
in most \s-2@DDD@\s+2 configurations.  See also
\fB\-\-panned\-graph\fR, above.
.TP
.B \-\-synchronous\-debugger
Do not process X events while the debugger is busy.  This may result
in slightly better performance on single-processor systems.
.TP
.B \-\-trace\-dialog
Show the interaction between \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and the inferior debugger
on standard error.  This is useful for debugging \s-2@DDD@\s+2.
.TP
.B \-\-trace\-shell
Show the shell commands issued by \s-2@DDD@\s+2 on standard error.  This
is useful for debugging \s-2@DDD@\s+2.
.TP
.B \-\-trace
Show both interaction and shell commands.
.TP
.B \-\-tty
Enable \s-2TTY\s+2 interface, taking additional debugger commands
from standard input and forwarding debugger output on standard output.
Current positions are issued in a format readable for humans.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 version and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-vsl\-library \fIlibrary\fR
Load the \s-2VSL\s+2 library \fIlibrary\fR instead of using the
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 built-in library.  This is useful for customizing
display shapes and fonts.
.TP
.B \-\-vsl\-path \fIpath\fR
Search \s-2VSL\s+2 libraries in \fIpath\fR (a colon-separated
directory list).

.SH LIMITATIONS
.\" ---------------
.SS "General Limitations"
If command output is sent to the command window, it is impossible for
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 to distinguish between the output of the debugged
program and the output of the inferior debugger.  For instance, if
your program output includes debugger prompts, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 will
become confused.  Using the separate execution window avoids these
problems.

.SS "Limitations using GDB"
Some \s-2GDB\s+2 settings are essential for \s-2@DDD@\s+2 to work correctly.
These settings with their correct values are:
.sp
.br
  \fBset height 0\fR
.br
  \fBset width 0\fR
.br
  \fBset print pretty\fR
.br
  \fBset print repeats 0\fR
.br
  \fBset verbose off\fR
.br
  \fBset prompt (gdb) \fR
.br
.sp
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 sets these values automatically when invoking \s-2GDB\s+2.
.PP
If these values are changed, there may be some malfunctions,
especially in the data display.  If you want to display C strings
(i.e., `\fBchar *\fR'-fields), it might be useful to change the
settings of `\fBprint repeats\fR' and `\fBprint elements\fR'.  But to
recognize array structures correctly, you should have `\fBprint
repeats\fR' set to 0.  Also, do not change the setting of `\fBprint
elements\fR' while there are array structures in the data display.

.SS "Limitations using DBX"
When used for debugging \s-2MODULA-2\s+2 or \s-2PASCAL\s+2 programs,
\s-2DDD\s+2 always numerates array elements starting with zero,
instead of using correct array subscripts.  This shall be fixed in a
future \s-2@DDD@\s+2 release.
.PP
Using \s-2DBX\s+2 3.x or later as inferior debugger, \s-2@DDD@\s+2
strips C-style and C++-style comments from the \s-2DBX\2+2 output in
order to operate properly.  This also affects the output of the
debugged program when sent to the command window.  Using the separate
execution window avoids these problems.


.\" ---------------
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
If you find a bug in \s-2@DDD@\s+2, please send us a bug report.  We
will either attempt to fix the bug\(em\&or include the bug description
in the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 `\fBBUGS\fR' file, such that others can attempt
to fix it.  (Instead of sending bug reports, you may also send
\fIfixes\fR; \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is an excellent tool for debugging itself
:-)

.SS "Where to Send Bug Reports"
We recommend that you send bug reports for \s-2@DDD@\s+2 via electronic
mail to

.SS "Is it a \s-2@DDD@\s+2 Bug?"
Before sending in a bug report, try to find out whether the problem
cause really lies within \s-2@DDD@\s+2.  A common cause of problems
are incomplete or missing X or Motif installations, for instance, or
bugs in the X server or Motif itself.  Running \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as
.PP
.br
.sp
  \fB@ddd@ \-\-check\-configuration\fR
.sp
.br
checks for common problems and gives hints on how to repair them.
.PP
Another potential cause of problems is the inferior \s-2GDB\s+2 or
\s-2DBX\s+2 debugger; although unlikely, they may have bugs.  To find
out whether a bug was caused by \s-2GDB\s+2 or \s-2DBX\s+2, run
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 as
.br
.sp
  \fB@ddd@ \-\-trace\-dialog\fR
.sp
.br
This shows the dialog between \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and the inferior
debugger on standard error while \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is running.  Compare
the debugger output to the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 output and determine which
one is wrong.

.SS "How to Report Bugs"
Here are some guidelines for bug reports:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
\fIreport all the facts\fR.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known.  It is not very important what happens
if the bug is already known.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug is not known.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Your bug report should be self-contained.  Do not refer to information
sent in previous mails; your previous mail may have been forwarded to
somebody else.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Please report each bug in a separate message.  This makes it easier
for us to track which bugs have been fixed and to forward your bugs
reports to the appropriate maintainer.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Please report bugs in English; this increases the chances of finding
someone who can fix the bug.  Do not assume one particular person will
receive your bug report.
.br
.PP

.SS "What to Include in a Bug Report"
To enable us to fix a \s-2@DDD@\s+2 bug, you \fImust\fR include the
following information:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Your \s-2@DDD@\s+2 configuration.  Invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as
.br
.sp
  \fB@ddd@ \-\-configuration\fR
.sp
.br
to get the configuration information.  If this does not work, please
include at least the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 version, the type of machine you
are using, and its operating system name and version number.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The debugger you are using and its version (e.g., `\fBgdb-4.14\fR' or
`\fBdbx as shipped with Solaris 2.4\fR').
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The compiler you used to compile \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and its version (e.g.,
`\fBgcc-2.6.3\fR').
.br
.IP \(bu 2
A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, \*(lq\s-2DDD\s+2 gets a fatal signal\*(rq or
\*(lq\s-2DDD\s+2 exits immediately after attempting to create the data
window\*(lq.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
If possible, include a \fIdialog trace\fR showing the interaction
between \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and the inferior debugger.  Such a dialog
trace is created by invoking \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with the `\fB\-\-trace\fR'
option.  Include all trace output from the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 invocation up
to the first bug occurrence.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
If you wish to suggest changes to the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 source, send us context
diffs.  If you even discuss something in the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 source, refer to
it by context, \fInever\fR by line number.

.PP
Be sure to include this information in \fIevery\fR single bug report.

.SH HISTORY
.\" ---------------
.\"
The history of \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is a story of code recycling.  The oldest
parts of \s-2@DDD@\s+2 were written in 1990, when \fIAndreas Zeller\fR
designed \s-2VSL\s+2, a box-based visual structure language for
visualizing data and program structures.  The \s-2VSL\s+2 interpreter
and the \s-2BOX\s+2 library became part of Andreas' Diploma Thesis, a
graphical syntax editor based on the Programming System Generator
\s-2PSG\s+2.

.PP
In 1992, the \s-2VSL\s+2 and Box libraries were recycled for the
\s-2NORA\s+2 project.  For \s-2NORA\s+2, an experimental
inference-based software development tool set, Andreas wrote a graph
editor (based on \s-2VSL\s+2 and the \s-2BOX\s+2 libraries) and
facilities for inter-process knowledge exchange.  Based on these
tools, \fIDorothea Luetkehaus\fR realized \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as her Diploma
Thesis, 1994.

.PP
The original \s-2@DDD@\s+2 had no source window; this was added by
Dorothea during the winter of 1994/1995.  In the first quarter of
1995, finally, Andreas completed \s-2@DDD@\s+2 by adding command and
execution windows, extensions for \s-2DBX\s+2 and remote debugging as
well as configuration support for several architectures.  Since then,
many people have contributed to the success of \s-2@DDD@\s+2; see the
file `\fBCONTRIBUTORS\fR' in the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 distribution for details.

.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 1.0 was released in May, 1995.
