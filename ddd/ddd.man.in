.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.\" ---------------
.\"
The purpose of a debugger such as \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is to allow you to see
what is going on \*(lqinside\*(rq another program while it
executes\(em\&or what another program was doing at the moment it
crashed.
.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
.IP \(bu 2
Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
behavior.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Make your program stop on specified conditions.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
.PP
.\"
\*(lqClassical\*(rq \s-2UNIX\s+2 debuggers such as the \s-2GNU\s+2
debugger (\s-2GDB\s+2) provide a command-line interface and a
multitude of commands for these and other debugging purposes.
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 is a \fIwrapper\fR around an inferior \s-2GDB\s+2,
\s-2DBX\s+2, \s-2XDB\s+2, or \s-2JDB\s+2 debugger.  In addition to the
command-line interface of the inferior debugger, \s-2@DDD@\s+2
provides a common \fIgraphical user interface\fR to support debugging
tasks.  The \s-2@DDD@\s+2 \fIgraphical data display\fR allows for
interactive exploration of data structures.
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "INVOKING @DDD@"
.\" ---------------
.\"
You can run \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with no arguments or options.  However, the
most usual way to start \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is with one argument or two,
specifying an executable program as the argument:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\ core\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want
to debug a running process:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\ 1234\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
would attach \s-2@DDD@\s+2 to process \c
.B 1234\c
\& (unless you also have a file
named `\|\c
.B 1234\c
\&\|'; \s-2@DDD@\s+2 does check for a core file first).
.\"
.PP
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 uses \s-2GDB\s+2 as inferior debugger.  Use
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-dbx \fIprogram\fR
.br
.sp
or
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-xdb \fIprogram\fR
.br
.sp
or
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-jdb \fIclass\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
to run \s-2DBX\s+2 or \s-2XDB\s+2 or \s-2JDB\s+2 as inferior debugger.
.PP
To learn more about \s-2@DDD@\s+2 options, run
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-help\fR
.br
.sp
to get a list of frequently used options, or see the `\fBOPTIONS\fR'
section, below.
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "THE DDD WINDOWS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-all.ps 15.3cm
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 is composed of three main windows:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIData Window\fR shows the current data of the debugged program.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fISource Window\fR shows the current source code of the debugged
program.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIDebugger Console\fR accepts debugger commands and shows
debugger messages.
.PP
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 groups these main windows into one single
window, but \s-2@DDD@\s+2 can also be configured to treat each one
separately.
.PP
Besides these main windows, there are some other optional windows
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fICommand Tool\fR offers buttons for frequently used commands.
It is usually placed on the source window.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIMachine Code Window\fR shows the current machine code.  It is
usually placed beneath the current source.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIExecution Window\fR shows the input and output of the debugged
program.
.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 also has several temporary \fIdialogs\fR for showing and
entering additional information.
.PP
In this manual page, we discuss all the functionality associated with
these windows.  We start with the debugger console and its commands,
continue with the source window, and continue with the data window.
But before that, we tell you how to get help while working with
\s-2@DDD@\s+2.
.\"
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "GETTING HELP"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.SS "Button Tips"
.\"
You can get a short help text on most \s-2@DDD@\s+2 buttons by simply
moving the mouse pointer on it and leave it there.  After a second, a
small window (called \fIbutton tip\fR) pops up, giving a hint on the
button's meaning.  The button tip disappears as soon as you move the
mouse pointer to another item.
.\"
.SS "The Status Line"
.\"
The status line also displays information about the currently selected
item.  By clicking on the status line, you can redisplay the most
recent messages.
.\"
.SS "Context-Sensitive Help"
.\"
You can get detailed help on any visible \s-2@DDD@\s+2 item.  Just
press the `\fBF1\fR' key and move the question mark arrow on the item
you want help for.  Clicking on the item pops up a detailed help text.
.PP
The \s-2@DDD@\s+2 dialogs all contain `\fBHelp\fR' buttons that give
detailed information about the dialog.
.\"
.SS "Help on Debugger Commands"
.\"
You can get help on debugger commands by entering `\fBhelp\fR' at the
debugger prompt.
.PP
See `\fBEntering Commands\fR', below, for details on entering commands.
.\"
.SS "Are You Stuck?"
.\"
In case you're stuck, try `\fBHelp | What Now?\fR' (the `\fBWhat
Now\fR' item in the `\fBHelp\fR' menu) or press \fBShift+F1\fR.
Depending on the current state, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 will give you some hints
on what you can do.
.\"
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "ENTERING COMMANDS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
In the \fIdebugger console\fR, you can interact with the command
interface of the inferior debugger.  Enter commands at the \fIdebugger
prompt\fR\(em\&that is, `\fB(gdb)\fR' for \s-2GDB\s+2, `\fB(dbx)\fR'
for \s-2DBX\s+2, `\fB>\fR' for \s-2XDB\s+2, and `\fB>\fR' or
`\fIthread\fB[\fIdepth\fB]\fR' for \s-2JDB\s+2.  You can use arbitrary
debugger commands; use the \s-2\fBRETURN\fR\s+2 key to enter them.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-console.ps 15.3cm
.PP
You can \fIrepeat\fR previous and next commands by pressing the
`\fBUp\fR' and `\fBDown\fR' arrow keys, respectively.  If you enter an
empty line, the last command is repeated as well.  `\fBCommands |
Command History\fR' shows the command history.
.PP
You can \fIsearch\fR for previous commands by pressing `\fBCtrl+R\fR'.
This invokes \fIincremental search mode,\fR where you can enter a
string to be searched in previous commands.  Press `\fBCtrl+R\fR'
again to repeat the search, or `\fBCtrl+S\fR' to search in the reverse
direction.  To return to normal mode, press \s-2\fBESC\fR\s+2, or use
any cursor command.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-history.ps 15.3cm
.PP
Using \s-2GDB\s+2, you can also \fIcomplete\fR commands and arguments
by pressing the `\s-2\fBTAB\fR\s+2' key; pressing the `\s-2\fBTAB\fR\s+2'
key multiple times shows one possible expansion after the other.
.PP
Here are some of the most frequently needed debugger commands.

If you did not invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2 specifying a program to be debugged,
you can use the `\fBFile\fR' menu to open programs, core dumps and
sources.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-open.ps 15.3cm
.PP
To open a program to be debugged, select `\fBFile | Open Program\fR'.
.PP
To open a core dump for the program, select `\fBFile | Open Core
Dump\fR' Before `\fBOpen Core Dump\fR', you should first use `\fBFile
| Open Program\fR' to specify the program that generated the core dump
and to load its symbol table.
.PP
To open an arbitrary source file, select `\fBFile | Open Source\fR'.
This works best if the given source file is actually related to the
debugged program.
.PP
Note: With \s-2XDB\s+2 and some \s-2DBX\s+2 versions, the debugged
program must be specified upon invocation and cannot be changed at run
time.
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "LOOKING UP ITEMS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
If the source of the debugged program is available, the \fIsource
window\fR displays its current source text.  (If a source text cannot
be found, use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBdirectory\fR' command to specify
source text directories).
.PP
In the source window, you can lookup and examine function and variable
definitions as well as search for arbitrary occurrences in the source
text.
.\"
.SS "Looking up Definitions"
.\"
If you wish to lookup a specific function or variable definition whose
name is visible in the source text, click with \fImouse button 1\fR on the
function or variable name.  The name is copied to the argument field.
Click on the `\fBLookup ()\fR' button to find its definition.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-source-popup.ps 15.3cm
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press \fImouse button 3\fR on the
function name and select the `\fBLookup\fR' item from the source popup
menu.
.PP
As another alternative, you can enter the function name in the
argument field and click on the `\fBLookup ()\fR' button to find its
definition.
.PP
Finally, you can use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBinfo line\fR' command.
Type `\fBhelp info line\fR' at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt for
details.
.\"
.SS "Textual Search"
.\"
If the item you wish to search is visible in the source text, click
with \fImouse button 1\fR on it.  The identifier is copied to the argument
field.  Click on the `\fBFind\s-2>>\s+2 ()\fR' button to find
following occurrences and on the `\fBFind\s-2<<\s+2 ()\fR' button to
find previous occurrences.
.PP
As an alternative, you can enter the item in the argument field and

button.
.PP
As yet another alternative, you can select `\fBSource | Edit
Breakpoints\fR'.  Click on the `\fBNew\fR' button and enter the line
number.
.PP
And finally, you can also use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBbreak\fR' command or
the \s-2DBX\s+2/\s-2JDB\s+2 `\fBstop\fR' commands.  Type `\fBhelp
break\fR' at the `\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt (or `\fBhelp stop\fR' at the
`\fB(dbx)\fR' prompt) for details.  The \s-2XDB\s+2 `\fBb\fR' command
works as well.
.PP
(If you find this number of alternatives confusing, be aware that
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 users fall into three categories, which must all be
supported.  \fINovice users\fR explore \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and may prefer to
use one single mouse button.  \fIAdvanced users\fR know how to use
shortcuts and prefer popup menus.  \fIExperienced users\fR prefer the
command line interface.)
.PP
Breakpoints are indicated by a plain stop sign, or as
`\fB#\fIn\fB#\fR', where \fIn\fR is the breakpoint number.  A greyed
out stop sign (or `\fB_\fIn\fB_\fR') indicates a disabled breakpoint.
A stop sign with a question mark (or `\fB?\fIn\fB?\fR') indicates a
conditional breakpoint or a breakpoint with an ignore count set.
.PP
Note: some Motif/X server combinations may fail to display stop signs
correctly.  If this happens, try writing in your
`\fB$HOME/.@ddd@/init\fR' file:
.br
.sp
  \fB@Ddd@*cacheGlyphImages: off\fR

.SS "Moving Breakpoints"
.\"
To move a breakpoint to a different location, press \fImouse button 1\fR on
the stop sign and drag it to the desired location.  This is equivalent
to deleting the breakpoint at the old location and setting a
breakpoint at the new location.  The new breakpoint inherits all
properties of the old breakpoint, except the breakpoint number.
.PP
Note: Dragging breakpoints is not possible when glyphs are disabled.
Delete and set breakpoints instead.

To set a breakpoint condition, select the appropriate breakpoint in
the Breakpoint Editor and click on the `\fBCondition\fR' button.
You can then enter (or change) the condition in a special dialog.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-cond.ps 15.3cm

.SS "Breakpoint Ignore Counts"
.\"
Note: \s-2JDB\s+2 and some \s-2DBX\s+2 variants do not support
breakpoint ignore counts.
.PP
Using the Breakpoint Editor (invoked through `\fBSource | Edit
Breakpoints\fR'), you can specify \fIignore counts\fR.  If an ignore
count is set, each crossing of the breakpoint decrements the ignore
count.  The program stops only if the ignore count is zero.
.PP
To set a breakpoint ignore count, select the appropriate breakpoint in
the Breakpoint Editor and click on the `\fBIgnore Count\fR' button.
You can then enter (or change) the ignore count in a special dialog.

Using \s-2GDB\s+2, several more breakpoint features can be invoked
through the debugger console.  Enter `\fBhelp breakpoints\fR' at the
`\fB(gdb)\fR' prompt.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "RUNNING THE PROGRAM"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.SS "Using the Command Tool"
.\"
All functionality you need for running and stopping the debugged
program can be found on the command tool.
.PP
The command tool is a small window containing the most frequently used
commands.  It can be moved around on top of the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 windows,
but it can also be placed besides them.  Whenever you save
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 state, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 also saves the distance between
command tool and source window, such that you can select your own
individual command tool placement.  In case you want to move the
command tool to its saved position, use `\fBView | Command Tool\fR'.
.PP
By default, the command tool \fIsticks\fR to the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 source
window: Whenever you move the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 source window, the command
tool follows such that the distance between source window and command
tool remains the same.  By default, the command tool also is
\fIauto-raised\fR, such that it stays on top of other \s-2@DDD@\s+2
windows.
.PP

.\"
.SS "Starting Program Execution"
.\"
To start execution of the debugged program, select `\fBProgram |
Run\fR'.  You will then be prompted for the arguments to give to your
program.  You can either select from a list of previously used
arguments or enter own arguments in the text field.  Afterwards, press
the `\fBOK\fR' button to start execution with the selected arguments.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-arguments.ps 15.3cm
.PP
To run your program again, with the same arguments, select `\fBProgram
| Run Again\fR' or press the `\fBRun\fR' button on the command tool.
You may also enter `\fBrun\fR', followed by arguments at the debugger
prompt instead.
.PP
By default, input and output of the debugged program go to the
debugger console.  As an alternative, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 can also invoke an
\fIexecution window\fR, where the program terminal input and output is
shown.  See `\fBProgram | Run in Execution Window\fR' for details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Attaching to a Running Process"
.\"
Note: \s-2JDB\s+2 does not support attaching to processes.
.PP
If the debugged program is already running in some process, you can
\fIattach\fR to this process (instead of starting a new one with
`\fBRun\fR').  Select `\fBFile | Attach to Process\fR' to choose from
a list of processes.  Afterwards, press the `\fBAttach\fR' button to
attach to the specified process.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-attach.ps 15.3cm
.PP
The first thing \s-2@DDD@\s+2 does after arranging to debug the
specified process is to stop it. You can examine and modify an
attached process with all the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 commands that are
ordinarily available when you start processes with `\fBRun\fR'. You
can insert breakpoints; you can step and continue; you can modify
storage. If you would rather the process continue running, you may use
`\fBContinue\fR' after attaching \s-2@DDD@\s+2 to the process.
.PP
When using `\fBAttach to Process\fR', you should first use `\fBOpen
Program\fR' to specify the program running in the process and load its
symbol table.
.PP
When you have finished debugging the attached process, you can use the
`\fBFile | Detach Process\fR' to release it from \s-2@DDD@\s+2
control.  Detaching the process continues its execution.  After
`\fBDetach Process\fR', that process and \s-2@DDD@\s+2 become
completely independent once more, and you are ready to attach another
process or start one with `\fBRun\fR'.
.PP
You can customize the list of processes shown.  See the
`\fBpsCommand\fR' resource for details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Stopping the Program"
.\"
The program stops as soon as a breakpoint is reached.  The current
execution position is highlighted by an arrow.
.PP
You can interrupt a running program any time by clicking the
`\fBInterrupt\fR' button or typing \fBCtrl+C\fR in a \s-2@DDD@\s+2 window.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Resuming Execution"
.\"
To resume execution, at the address where your program last stopped,
click on the `\fBContinue\fR` button.  Any breakpoints set at that
address are bypassed.
.PP
To execute just one source line, click on the `\fBStep\fR' button.
The program is executed until control reaches a different source line,
which may be in a different function.
.PP
To continue to the next line in the current function, click on the
`\fBNext\fR' button.  This is similar to `\fBStep\fR', but any
function calls appearing within the line of code are executed without
stopping.
.PP
To continue running until the current function returns, use the
`\fBFinish\fR' button.  The returned value (if any) is printed.
.PP
To continue running until a line after the current source line is
reached, use the `\fBContinue Until Here\fR' facility from the line
popup menu.  See the `\fBTemporary Breakpoints\fR' section, above, for
a discussion.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SS "Altering the Execution Position"
.\"
Note: \s-2JDB\s+2 does not support altering the execution position.
.PP
To resume execution at a different location, press \fImouse button 1\fR on
the arrow and drag it to a different location.  The most common
occasion to use this feature is to back up\(em\&perhaps with more
breakpoints set-over a portion of a program that has already executed,
in order to examine its execution in more detail.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-drag.ps 15.3cm
.PP
Moving the execution position does not change the current stack frame,
or the stack pointer, or the contents of any memory location or any
register other than the program counter.
.PP
Some inferior debuggers (notably \s-2GDB\s+2) allow you to set the new
execution position into a different function from the one currently
executing.  This may lead to bizarre results if the two functions
expect different patterns of arguments or of local variables.  For
this reason, moving the execution position requests confirmation if
the specified line is not in the function currently executing.
.PP
After moving the execution position, click on the `\fBContinue\fR'
button to resume execution.
.PP
Note: Dragging the execution position is not possible when glyphs are
disabled.  Use `\fBSet Execution Position\fR' from the breakpoint
popup menu instead to set the execution position to the current
location.  This item is also accessible by pressing and holding the
`\fBBreak at ()\fR/\fBClear at ()\fR' button.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Examining the Stack"
.\"
When your program has stopped, the first thing you need to know is
where it stopped and how it got there.
.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides a \fIbacktrace window\fR showing a summary of 
how your program got where it is.  To enable the backtrace window,
select `\fBStatus | Backtrace\fR'.
.PP
The `\fBUp\fR' button selects the function that called the current
one.
.PP
The `\fBDown\fR' button selects the function that was called by
the current one.
.PP
You can also directly type the `\fBup\fR' and `\fBdown\fR' commands at
the debugger prompt.  Typing \fBCtrl+Up\fR and \fBCtrl+Down\fR,
respectively, will also move you through the stack.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-backtrace.ps 15.3cm
.\"
.\"
.SS "Examining Threads"
.\"
Note: Thread support is available with \s-2GDB\s+2 and \s-2JDB\s+2 only.
.PP
In some operating systems, a single program may have more than one
\fIthread\fR of execution.  The precise semantics of threads differ
from one operating system to another, but in general the threads of a
single program are akin to multiple processes\(em\&except that they
share one address space (that is, they can all examine and modify the
same variables).  On the other hand, each thread has its own registers
and execution stack, and perhaps private memory.
.PP
For debugging purposes, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 lets you display the list of
threads currently active in your program and lets you select the
\fIcurrent thread\fR\(em\&the thread which is the focus of debugging.
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 shows all program information from the perspective of
the current thread.
.PP
To view all currently active threads in your program, select
`\fBStatus | Threads\fR'.  The current thread is highlighted.  Select
any thread to make it the current thread.
.PP

.SH "EXAMINING DATA"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.TP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides three means to examine data.
.TP 10
.B "Value Hints"
The quickest way to examine variables is to move the pointer on an
occurrence in the source text.  The value is displayed in the source
line; after a second, a popup window shows the variable value.  This
is useful for quick examination of several simple variables.
.TP 10
.B "Printing Values"
If you want to reuse variable values at a later time, you can print
the value in the debugger console.  This allows for displaying and
examining larger data structures.
.TP 10
.B "Displaying Values"
If you want to examine complex data structures, you can display them
graphically in the data display.  Displays remain effective until you
delete them; they are updated each time the program stops.  This is
useful for large dynamic structures.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS "Displaying Simple Values"
.\"
To display the value of a simple variable, move the mouse pointer on
its name.  After a second, a small window (called \fIvalue tip\fR)
pops up showing the value of the variable pointed at.  The window
disappears as soon as you move the mouse pointer away from the
variable.  The value is also shown in the status line.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-value-tip.ps 15.3cm

The variable value can also be printed in the debugger console, making
it available for further operations.  To print a variable value,
select the desired variable by clicking \fImouse button 1\fR on its name.
The variable name is copied to the argument field.  By clicking the
`\fBPrint ()\fR' button, a new display is created in the data window.

.SS "Displaying Multiple Array Items"
.\"
When debugging C or C++ programs, one often has to deal with pointers
to arrays of dynamically determined size.  Both \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and
\s-2GDB\s+2 provide special support for such dynamic arrays.
.PP
To display several successive objects of the same type (a section of
an array, or an array of dynamically determined size), use the
notation \fB[\fIfrom\fB..\fIto\fB]\fR in display expressions.
\fIfrom\fR and \fIto\fR denote the first and last array position to
display.  Thus,
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display argv[0..9]\fR
.sp
.br
creates ten new display nodes for `\fBargv[0]\fR',
`\fBargv[1]\fR', ..., `\fBargv[9]\fR'.
.PP
Using \s-2GDB\s+2 as inferior debugger, you can use \fIartificial arrays\fR.
Typing
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display argv[0] @ 10\fR
.sp
.br
creates a single array display node containing `\fBargv[0]\fR' up to
`\fBargv[9]\fR'.  Generally, by using the `\fB@\fR' operator, you
can specify the number of array elements to be displayed.
.PP
For more details on artificial arrays, see the \s-2GDB\s+2 documentation.

the display and select the `\fBDelete Display\fR' item.
.PP
When a display is deleted, its immediate ancestors and descendants are

.SS "Examining Shared Data Structures"
.\"
By default, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 does not recognize shared data
structures\(em\&that is, a data object referenced by multiple other
data objects.  For instance, if two pointers \fBp1\fR and \fBp2\fR
point at the same data object \fBd\fR, the data displays \fBd\fR,
\fB*p1\fR, and \fB*p2\fR will be separate, although they denote the
same object.
.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides a special mode which makes it detect these
situations.  \s-2@DDD@\s+2 recognizes if two or more data displays are
stored at the same physical address, and if this is so, merges all
these \fIaliases\fR into one single data display, the \fIoriginal data
display\fR.  This mode is called \fIAlias Detection\fR; it is enabled
via the `\fBData | Detect Aliases\fR'.
.PP
When alias detection is enabled, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 inquires the memory
location (the \fIaddress\fR) of each data display after each program
step.  If two displays have the same address, they are merged into
one.  More specifically, only the one which has least recently changed
remains (the \fIoriginal data display\fR); all other aliases are
\fIsuppressed\fR, i.e. completely hidden.  The edges leading to the
aliases are replaced by edges leading to the original data display.
.PP
An edge created by alias detection is somewhat special: rather than
connecting two displays directly, it goes through an \fIedge hint\fR,
describing an arc connecting the two displays and the edge hint.
.PP
Each edge hint is a placeholder for a suppressed alias; selecting an
edge hint is equivalent to selecting the alias.  This way, you can
easily delete display aliases by simply selecting the edge hint and
clicking on `\fBUndisplay ()\fR'.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-aliases.ps 15.3cm
.PP
To access suppressed display aliases, you can also use the Display
Editor.  Suppressed displays are listed in the Display Editor as
\fIaliases\fR of the original data display.  Via the Display Editor,
you can select, change, and delete suppressed displays.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-edit-displays.ps 15.3cm
.PP
Suppressed displays become visible again as soon as
.br
.IP \(bu 2
alias detection is disabled, 
.br
.IP \(bu 2
their address changes such that they are no more aliases, or
.br
.IP \(bu 2
the original data display is deleted, such that the least recently
changed alias becomes the new original data display.
.PP
Please note the following \fIcaveats\fR with alias detection:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Alias detection requires that the current programming language
provides a means to determine the address of an arbitrary data
object.  Currently, only C and C++ are supported.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Some inferior debuggers (for instance, SunOS \s-2DBX\s+2) produce
incorrect output for address expressions.  Given a pointer \fBp\fR,
you may verify the correct function of your inferior debugger by
comparing the values of \fBp\fR and \fB&p\fR (unless \fBp\fR actually
points to itself).  You can also examine the data display addresses,
as shown in the Display Editor.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Alias detection slows down \s-2@DDD@\s+2 considerably, which is why it
is disabled by default.  You may consider to enable it only at
need\(em\&for instance, while examining some complex data
structure\(em\&and disable it while examining control flow (i.e.,
stepping through your program).  \s-2@DDD@\s+2 will automatically
restore edges and data displays when switching modes.
.PP

.SS "Refreshing the Data Window"
.\"
The data window refreshes itself automatically each time the program
stops.  Values that have changed are highlighted.
.PP
However, there are some situations where you should refresh the data
window explicitly.  The data window should be refreshed whenever:
.br
.IP \(bu 2

The \s-2@DDD@\s+2 data window offers some basic functionality to
manipulate the display graph.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Moving Displays Around"
.\"
From time to time, you may wish to move displays at another place in
the data window.  You can move a single display by pressing and
holding \fImouse button 1\fR on the display title.  Moving the pointer while
holding the button causes all selected displays to move along with the
pointer.
.PP
If the data window becomes too small to hold all displays, scroll bars
are created.  If your \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is set up to use \fIpanners\fR
instead, a panner is created in the lower right edge.  When the panner
is moved around, the window view follows the position of the panner.
See `\fBCUSTOMIZING @DDD@\fR', below, for details on how to set up
scroll bars or panners.
.PP
For fine-grain movements, selected displays may also be moved using
the arrow keys.  Pressing \fBShift\fR and an arrow key moves displays
by single pixels.  Pressing \fBCtrl\fR and arrow keys moves displays
by grid positions.
.PP
Edge hints can be selected and moved around like other displays.  If
an arc goes through the edge hint, you can change the shape of the arc
by moving the edge hint around.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Aligning Displays"
.\"
You can align all displays on the nearest grid position by selecting
`\fBData | Align on Grid\fR'.  This is useful for keeping edges
horizontal or vertical.
.PP
You can enforce alignment by selecting `\fBEdit | Preferences |
Data | Auto-align displays on nearest grid point\fR'.  If
this feature is enabled, displays can be moved on grid positions only.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Layouting the Display Graph"
.\"
You can layout the entire graph as a tree by selecting `\fBData |
Layout Graph\fR'.
.PP
Layouting the graph may introduce \fIedge hints\fR; that is, edges are
no more straight lines, but lead to an edge hint and from there to
their destination.  Edge hints can be moved around like arbitrary
displays.
.PP
To enable a more compact layout, you can set the `\fBEdit |
Preferences | Data | Use compact layout\fR' option.  This
realizes an alternate layout algorithm, where successors are placed
next to their parents.  This algorithm is suitable for homogeneous
data structures only.
.PP
You can enforce layout by setting `\fBEdit | Preferences | Data |

\s-2XDB\s+2 \fIassertions\fR; see the \s-2XDB\s+2 documentation for
details.
.PP
Using \fIwatchpoints\fR, you can make your program stop whenever the
value of an expression changes, without having to predict a particular
place where this may happen.
.PP
To create a new watchpoint, select the variable to be watched by
clicking \fImouse button 1\fR on its name.  The variable name is
copied to the argument field.  By clicking the `\fBWatch ()\fR'
button, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 places a watchpoint on that variable.  From now
on, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 will interrupt the debugged program whenever the
variable value changes.
.PP
Please note: on architectures without special watchpoint support,
watchpoints currently make the program execute two orders of magnitude
more slowly.  This is so because the inferior debugger must interrupt
the program after each machine instruction in order to examine whether
the watched value has changed.  However, this delay can be well worth
it to catch errors when you have no clue what part of your program is
the culprit.
.PP
If supported by your architecture, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 also allows you to
set \fIread watchpoints\fR, interrupting your program whenever a
variable is read, and \fIaccess watchpoints\fR, interrupting your
program whenever a variable is read or written.  These watchpoint
types can be selected from the pulldown menu obtained by pressing and
holding the `\fBWatch ()\fR' button.

Watchpoints can be manipulated like breakpoints; in particular, you
can disable them temporarily as well as set ignore counts and
conditions on them.  To edit watchpoints, select `\fBData | Edit

displays watchpoints.
.PP
To delete a watchpoint, select an occurrence of the variable in the

remote debugger, use the `\fB\-\-rhost\fR' option instead of
`\fB\-\-host\fR'.  This will invoke the remote debugger via an
interactive shell on the remote host, which may lead to better
results.
.br
Note: using `\fB\-\-rhost\fR', \s-2@DDD@\s+2 invokes the inferior
debugger as soon as a shell prompt appears.  The first output on the
remote host ending in a space character or `\fB>\fR' and not followed
by a newline is assumed to be a shell prompt.  If necessary, adjust
your shell prompt on the remote host.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
To run the remote program, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 invokes an `\fBxterm\fR' terminal
emulator on the remote host, giving your current `\fBDISPLAY\fR'

`\fBxterm\fR', or does not have access to your X display, start
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 with the `\fB\-\-no-exec-window\fR' option.  The program
input/output will then go through the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 debugger console.

Sometimes, you may require to debug programs with root privileges, but
without actually logging in as root.  This is usually done by
installing the debugger \fIsetuid root\fR, that is, having the
debugger run with root privileges.  For security reasons, you cannot
install \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as a setuid program; \s-2@DDD@\s+2 invokes shell
commands and even shell scripts, such that all known problems of
setuid shell scripts apply.  Instead, you should invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2
such that a \fIsetuid\fR copy of the inferior debugger is used.

Here is an example.  Have a \fIsetuid root\fR copy of \s-2GDB\s+2

\s-2@DDD@\s+2.
.\"
.SS "General Information"
.\"
To have \s-2@DDD@\s+2 run as an inferior debugger in other front-ends,
set up your debugger front-end such that `\fB@ddd@ \-\-tty\fR' is
invoked instead of the inferior debugger.  When \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is
invoked using the `\fB\-\-tty\fR' option, it enables its
\fI\s-2TTY\s+2 interface\fR, taking additional debugger commands from
standard input and forwarding debugger output to standard output, just
as if the inferior debugger had been invoked directly.  All remaining
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 functionality stays unchanged.
.PP
In case your debugger front-end uses the \s-2GDB\s+2
`\fB\-fullname\fR' option to have \s-2GDB\s+2 report source code
positions, the `\fB\-\-tty\fR' option is not required.  \s-2@DDD@\s+2
recognizes the `\fB\-fullname\fR' option, finds that it has been
invoked from a debugger front-end and automatically enables
the \s-2TTY\s+2 interface.
.PP
You may also invoke `\fB@ddd@ \-\-tty\fR' directly, entering
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 commands from your \s-2TTY\s+2, or use \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as
the end of a pipe, controlled by a remote program.  Be aware, however,
that the \s-2TTY\s+2 interface does not support line editing and
command completion and that \s-2@DDD@\s+2 exits as soon as it detects
an \s-2EOF\s+2 condition on its standard input.  Also, do not try to
run \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as inferior debugger.
.PP
Using \s-2@DDD@\s+2 in \s-2TTY\s+2 mode automatically disables some
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 windows, because it is assumed that their facilities are 
provided by the remote program:
.IP \(bu 2 
If \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is invoked with the `\fB\-\-tty\fR' option, the

If your debugger allows you to define own command sequences, you can
also use these \fIuser-defined commands\fR within \s-2@DDD@\s+2; just
enter them at the debugger prompt.  However, you may encounter some
problems:
.IP \(bu 2
In contrast to the well-documented commands of the inferior debugger, 
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 does not know what your specific command does.  This may 
lead to inconsistencies between \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and the inferior
debugger.  For instance, if your own command `\fBbp\fR' sets a
breakpoint, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 may not display it immediately, because
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 does not know that `\fBbp\fR' changes the breakpoint
state.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot use \s-2@DDD@\s+2 \fBgraph\fR commands within user-defined
commands.  This is only natural, because user-defined commands are
interpreted by the inferior debugger, which does not know about
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 commands.
.PP
As a solution, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 provides a simple facility called
\fIauto-commands\fR.  If \s-2@DDD@\s+2 receives any output from the
inferior debugger in the form `\fB@ddd@: \fIcommand\fR', it will
interpret \fIcommand\fR as if it had been entered at the debugger
prompt.
.PP
Suppose you want to define a \s-2GDB\s+2 command `\fBdispfoo\fR' that
creates a data display containing the variable \fIfoo\fR.  All
\fBdispfoo\fR has to do is to issue a string
.br
.sp
  \fBddd: graph display foo\fR
.sp
.br
In \s-2GDB\s+2, this can be achieved using the \fBecho\fR command.  In 
your \fB$HOME/.gdbinit\fR file, insert the lines
.br
.sp
  \fBdefine dispfoo
    echo ddd: graph display foo
  end\fR
.sp
.br
Entering \fBdispfoo\fR will now have the same effect as entering
\fBgraph display foo\fR at the debugger prompt.
.PP
Unfortunately, auto-commands also raise a security problem, since
arbitrary commands can be executed.  Just imagine some malicuous
program issuing a string like `\fBddd: shell rm -fr $HOME\fR' when
being debugged!  Consequently, auto-commands are \fIdisabled\fR by
default and must be enabled explicitly.
.PP
To enable auto-commands, write in your `\fB$HOME/.@ddd@/init\fR' file:
.br
.sp
  \fB@Ddd@*autoCommands: on\fR
.sp
.br
The default prefix of auto-commands is `\fBddd: \fR'.  You are
encouraged to change this value in your `\fB.@ddd@/init\fR' file.  To use 
a prefix of, say, `\fBmagic123: \fR', write:
.br
.sp
  \fBDdd*autoCommandPrefix: magic123:\\ \fR
.sp
.br
Leave a space after the final `\fB\\\fR'.  Be sure to enable
auto-commands only if you have defined own commands; be sure to set up
an individual auto-command prefix to avoid security problems.

If you use \s-2GDB\s+2 (or some \s-2DBX\s+2 flavor) as inferior
debugger, you can change its settings using `\fBEdit | Settings\fR'.
Using the settings editor, you can determine whether C++ names are to
be demangled, how many array elements are to print, and so on.
.PP
The capabilities of the settings editor depend on the capabilities of
your inferior debugger\(em\&that is, your \s-2GDB\s+2 or \s-2DBX\s+2
version.  Clicking on `\fB?\fR' gives an an explanation on the
specific item; the \s-2GDB\s+2 documentation gives more details.
.PP
Clicking on `\fBReset\fR' restores the most recently saved settings.
.PP
Some debugger settings are insensitive and cannot be changed, because
doing so would endanger \s-2@DDD@\s+2 operation.  See the
`\fBgdbInitCommands\fR' and `\fBdbxInitCommands\fR' resources for

.SH "USING @DDD@ WITH LESSTIF"
.\" ---------------
.\"
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 2.1.1 and later include a number of hacks that make
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 run with \fILessTif,\fR a free Motif clone, without loss
of functionality.  Since a \s-2@DDD@\s+2 binary may be dynamically
bound and used with either an OSF/Motif or LessTif library, these
hacks can be enabled and disabled at run time.
.PP
Whether the hacks are included at run-time depends on the setting of
the `\fBlessTifVersion\fR' resource.  `\fBlessTifVersion\fR' indicates
the LessTif version against which \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is linked.  For
LessTif version \fIx.y\fR, its value is \fIx\fR multiplied by 1000
plus \fIy\fR\(em\&for instance, the value \fB88\fR stands for LessTif
0.88 and the value \fB1000\fR stands for LessTif 1.0.  To specify the
version number of the LessTif library at \s-2@DDD@\s+2 invocation, you
can also use the option `\fB\-\-lesstif-version\fR \fIversion\fR'.
.PP
The default value of the `\fBlessTifVersion\fR' resource is derived
from the LessTif library \s-2@DDD@\s+2 was compiled against (or
\fB1000\fR when compiled against OSF/Motif).  Hence, you normally
don't need to worry about the value of this resource.  However, if you
use a dynamically linked \s-2@DDD@\s+2 binary with a library other
than the one \s-2@DDD@\s+2 was compiled against, you must specify the
version number of the library using this resource.  (Unfortunately,
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 cannot detect this at run-time.)
.PP
Here are a few scenarios to illustrate this scheme:
.IP \(bu 2
Your \s-2@DDD@\s+2 binary was compiled against OSF/Motif, but you use
a LessTif 0.81 dynamic library instead.  Invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with
`\fB\-\-lesstif-version 81\fR'.
.IP \(bu 2
Your \s-2@DDD@\s+2 binary was compiled against LessTif, but you use
a OSF/Motif dynamic library instead.    Invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with
`\fB\-\-lesstif-version 1000\fR'.
.IP \(bu 2
Your \s-2@DDD@\s+2 binary was compiled against LessTif 0.81, and you
have upgraded to LessTif 0.90.  Invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with
`\fB\-\-lesstif-version 90\fR'.
.PP
To find out the LessTif or OSF/Motif version \s-2@DDD@\s+2 was
compiled against, invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2 with the
`\fB\-\-configuration\fR' option.

In the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 source, LessTif-specific hacks are controlled by
the string `\fBlesstif_version\fR'.

The following resources determine \s-2@DDD@\s+2 general behavior.
.TP
.B "buttonTips (\fPclass\fB Tips)"
Whether button tips are enabled (`\fBon\fR', default) or
not (`\fBoff\fR').  Button tips are helpful for novices, but
may be distracting for experienced users.
.TP
.B "buttonDocs (\fPclass\fB Docs)"
Whether the display of button hints in the status line is enabled
(`\fBon\fR', default) or not (`\fBoff\fR').
.TP
.B "globalTabCompletion (\fPclass\fB GlobalTabCompletion)"
If this is `\fBon\fR' (default), the \s-2\fBTAB\fR\s+2 key completes
arguments in all windows.  If this is `\fBoff\fR', the
\s-2\fBTAB\fR\s+2 key completes arguments in the debugger console
only.
.TP
.B "groupIconify (\fPclass\fB GroupIconify)"
If this is `\fBon\fR', (un)iconifying any \s-2@DDD@\s+2 window
causes all other \s-2@DDD@\s+2 windows to (un)iconify as well.
Default is `\fBoff\fR', meaning that each \s-2@DDD@\s+2 window can
be iconified on its own.
.TP
.B "saveHistoryOnExit (\fPclass\fB SaveHistoryOnExit)"
If `\fBon\fR' (default), the command history is automatically saved
when \s-2@DDD@\s+2 exits.
.TP
.B "showStartupLogo (\fPclass\fB ShowStartupLogo)"
If non-empty, show a \s-2@DDD@\s+2 splash screen upon start-up.
Possible values include: `\fBc\fR' for a color visual, `\fBg\fR' for a
multi-level greyscale visual, `\fBg4\fR' for a 4-level greyscale
visual, `\fBm\fR' for a dithered monochrome visual, and `\fB\fR' (the
empty string) for no splash screen at all.  The value `\fBbest\fR'
chooses the best visual available for your display.  Default is
`\fBg4\fR'.
.br
Note: if \s-2@DDD@\s+2 runs on a monochrome display, or if
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 was compiled without the \s-2XPM\s+2 library, only the
monochrome version (`\fBm\fR') can be shown.
.TP
.B "startupTips (\fPclass\fB StartupTips)"
Whether a tip of the day is to be shown at startup (`\fBon\fR',
default) or not (`\fBoff\fR').
.TP
.B "startupTipCount (\fPclass\fB StartupTipCount)"
The number \fIn\fR of the tip of the day to be shown at startup.  See
also the `\fBtip\fIn\fR' resources.
.TP
.B "suppressWarnings (\fPclass\fB SuppressWarnings)"
If `\fBon\fR', X warnings are suppressed.  This is
sometimes useful for executables that were built on a machine with a
different X or Motif configuration.  By default, this is
`\fBoff\fR'.
.TP
.B "tip\fIn\fR (\fPclass\fB Tip)"
The tip of the day numbered \fIn\fR (a string).
.TP
.B "ungrabMousePointer (\fPclass\fB UngrabMousePointer)"
When debugging a modal X application, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 may interrupt it
while it has grabbed the pointer, making further interaction
impossible.  If this is `\fBon\fR', \s-2@DDD@\s+2 will check after
each interaction whether the pointer is grabbed.  If this is so,
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 will instruct the debugged program to ungrab the mouse
pointer.  The default setting is `\fBoff\fR', since this feature is
known to interfere with some Motif versions (popup menus won't work).
.TP
.B "uniconifyWhenReady (\fPclass\fB UniconifyWhenReady)"
If this is `\fBon\fR' (default), the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 windows are
uniconified automatically whenever \s-2GDB\s+2 becomes ready.  This
way, you can iconify \s-2@DDD@\s+2 during some longer operation and
have it uniconify itself as soon as the program stops.  Setting this
to `\fBoff\fR' leaves the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 windows iconified.
.TP
.B "valueTips (\fPclass\fB Tips)"
Whether value tips are enabled (`\fBon\fR', default) or not
(`\fBoff\fR').  Value tips affect \s-2@DDD@\s+2 performance and may
be distracting for some experienced users.

has been reported to fail with Motif 2.1 on XFree86 servers.  Default
is `\fBoff\fR' for Motif 2.1 or later on Linux machines, and
`\fBon\fR' otherwise.

.TP
.B "cacheSourceFiles (\fPclass\fB CacheSourceFiles)"
Whether to cache source files (`\fBon\fR', default) or not

If this is `\fBon\fR' (default), the `\fBFind\fR' commands find
complete words only.  Otherwise, arbitrary occurrences are found.
.TP
.B "glyphUpdateDelay (\fPclass\fB GlyphUpdateDelay)"
A delay (in ms) that says how much time to wait before updating glyphs
while scrolling the source text.  A small value results in glyphs
being scrolled with the text, a large value disables glyphs while
scrolling and makes scrolling faster.  Default: \fB10\fR.

Maximum number of bytes to disassemble (default: 256).  If this is
zero, the entire current function is disassembled.
.TP
.B "maxGlyphs (\fPclass\fB MaxGlyphs)"
The maximum number of glyphs to be displayed (default: 10).  Raising
this value causes more glyphs to be allocated, possibly wasting

move the command tool around.
.IP \(bu 2
If this is `\fBon\fR', \s-2@DDD@\s+2 realizes the command tool as a

inferior debugger closes its output channel).  This was the default
behavior in \s-2@DDD@\s+2 2.x and earlier.  If `\fBoff\fR' (default),
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 takes no special action.
.TP
.B "ttyMode (\fPclass\fB TTYMode)"
If `\fBon\fR', enable \s-2TTY\s+2 interface, taking additional

If `\fBon\fR', use the \s-2GDB\s+2 `\fBtty\fR' command for
redirecting input/output to the separate execution window.  If
`\fBoff\fR', use explicit redirection through shell redirection
operators `\fB<\fR' and `\fB>\fR'.  The default is `\fBoff\fR'

`\fB@LINE@\fR' is replaced by the current line number, `\fB@FILE@\fR'
by the file name.  The default is to invoke \fB$XEDITOR\fR first, then
\fB$EDITOR\fR, then \fBvi\fR:
.sp

.TP
.B "lessTifVersion (\fPclass\fB LessTifVersion)"
Indicates the LessTif version \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is running against.  For
LessTif version \fIx.y\fR, the value is \fIx\fR multiplied by 1000
plus \fIy\fR\(em\&for instance, the value \fB79\fR stands for LessTif
0.79 and the value \fB1005\fR stands for LessTif 1.5.
.br
If the value of this resource is less than 1000, indicating LessTif
0.99 or earlier, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 enables version-specific hacks to make
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 work around LessTif bugs and deficiencies.
.br
If \s-2@DDD@\s+2 was compiled against LessTif, the default value is
the value of the `\fBLessTifVersion\fR' macro in \fB<Xm/Xm.h>\fR.  If
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 was compiled against OSF/Motif, the default value is
\fB1000\fR, disabling all LessTif-specific hacks.
.TP

.SS "Limitations using GDB"
.\"
Some \s-2GDB\s+2 settings are essential for \s-2@DDD@\s+2 to work correctly.
These settings with their correct values are:
.sp
.br
  \fBset height 0\fR
.br
  \fBset width 0\fR
.br
  \fBset verbose off\fR
.br
  \fBset prompt (gdb) \fR
.br
.sp
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 sets these values automatically when invoking
\s-2GDB\s+2; If these values are changed, there may be some
malfunctions, especially in the data display.
.PP
When debugging at the machine level with \s-2GDB\s+2 4.12 and earlier
as inferior debugger, use a `\fBdisplay /x $pc\fR' command to ensure
the program counter value is updated correctly at each stop.  You may
also enter the command in \fB$HOME/.gdbinit\fR or (better yet) upgrade
to the most recent \s-2GDB\s+2 version.
.PP
.\"
.SS "Limitations using DBX"
.\"
When used for debugging Pascal-like programs, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 does not
infer correct array subscripts and always starts to count with 1.
.PP
With some \s-2DBX\s+2 versions (notably Solaris \s-2DBX\s+2),
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 strips C-style and C++-style comments from the
\s-2DBX\s+2 output in order to interpret it properly.  This also
affects the output of the debugged program when sent to the debugger
console.  Using the separate execution window avoids these problems.
.PP
In some \s-2DBX\s+2 versions (notably \s-2DEC\s+2 \s-2DBX\s+2 and
\s-2AIX\s+2 \s-2DBX\s+2), there is no automatic data display.  As an
alternative, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 uses the `\fBprint\fR' command to access
data values.  This means that variable names are interpreted according
to the current frame; variables outside the current frame cannot be
displayed.  This also means that displays slow down \s-2@DDD@\s+2
considerably.
.\"
.SS "Limitations using XDB"
.\"
There is no automatic data display in \s-2XDB\s+2.  As a workaround,
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 uses the `\fBp\fR' command to access data values.  This
means that variable names are interpreted according to the current
frame; variables outside the current frame cannot be displayed.  This
also means that displays slow down \s-2@DDD@\s+2 considerably.
.\"
.SS "Limitations using JDB"
.\"
.PP
There is no automatic data display in \s-2JDB\s+2.  As a workaround,
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 uses the `\fBdump\fR' command to access data values.
This means that variable names are interpreted according to the
current frame; variables outside the current frame cannot be
displayed.  This also means that displays slow down \s-2@DDD@\s+2
considerably.
.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 cannot find non-public classes unless they are defined
in a \fB.java\fR file named after the class.  This is so because
\s-2JDB\s+2 does not report file names, only classes.  Hence, to
display a class \fIC\fR, \s-2@DDD@\s+2 searches for the java file
\fB\fIC\fB.java\fR.  This heuristic fails for non-public classes
\fIC'\fR whose definition resides in
\fB\fIC\fB.java\fR\(em\&\s-2@DDD@\s+2 would search the definition in
\fB\fIC'\fB.java\fR instead and fail.  (If you know a way to have
\s-2JDB\s+2 report file names, please let us know.)
.PP
The \s-2JDB\s+2 `\fBdump\fR' and `\fBprint\fR' commands do not support
expression evaluation.  Hence, you cannot display arbitrary
expressions.
.PP
Parsing of \s-2JDB\s+2 output is quite CPU-intensive, due to the
recognition of asynchronous prompts (any thread may output anything at
any time, including prompts).  Hence, a program producing much console
output is likely to slow down \s-2@DDD@\s+2 considerably.  In such a
case, have the program run with \fB\-debug\fR in a separate window and
attach \s-2JDB\s+2 to it using the \fB\-passwd\fR option.
.\"
.SS "General Limitations"
.\"
If command output is sent to the debugger console, it is impossible
for \s-2@DDD@\s+2 to distinguish between the output of the debugged
program and the output of the inferior debugger.  This problem can be
avoided by running the program in the separate execution window.
.PP
Output that confuses \s-2@DDD@\s+2 includes:
.IP \(bu 2
Primary debugger prompts (e.g. `\fB(gdb) \fR' or `\fB(dbx) \fR')
.IP \(bu 2
Secondary debugger prompts (e.g. `\fB>\fR')
.IP \(bu 2 
Confirmation prompts (e.g. `\fB(y or n) \fR')
.IP \(bu 2
Prompts for more output (e.g. `\fBPress RETURN to continue\fR')
.IP \(bu 2
Display output (e.g. `\fB$pc = 0x1234\fR')
.PP
If your program outputs any of these strings, you should run it in the
separate execution window.
.PP
If the inferior debugger changes the default \s-2TTY\s+2 settings, for
instance through a `\fBstty\fR' command in its initialization file,
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 will likely become confused.  The same applies to
debugged programs which change the default \s-2TTY\s+2 settings.

.IP \(bu 2
\s-2JDB\s+2 as part of JDK 1.1 for Linux.
.PP
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 functionality largely depends on the capabilities of the
underlying debugger; best results are obtained with \s-2GDB\s+2.
.PP
To cope with the large variety of \s-2DBX\s+2 flavors, \s-2@DDD@\s+2
determines the \s-2DBX\s+2 capabilities dynamically at run-rime;
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 should thus adapt automatically to other \s-2DBX\s+2
variants.  Please let us know your experiences; use `\fB@ddd@
\-\-trace\fR' to see the \s-2@DDD@/DBX\s+2 interaction.
.\"
.SS "Can I use @DDD@ with Ada?"
Matthew Majka <\fBmmajka@cs5.dasd.honeywell.com\fR> says:  It works
very well.  You just need an Ada-aware version of GDB.  You can get
the patches from `\fBftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat/gdb/\fR'.
.\"
.SS "Is there an Athena Widgets port of @DDD@?"
No.  If you want \s-2@DDD@\s+2 running with a free widget set, you
should support the Hungry Programmer's Team\(em\&they develop LessTif, a
free Motif-compliant widget set.  Check out their \s-2WWW\s+2 page at
`\fBhttp://www.lesstif.org/\fR'.
.\"
.SS "Will @DDD@ work with LessTif?"
As of LessTif 0.83, the resulting \s-2@DDD@\s+2 executable is quite
usable; there are several \s-2@DDD@\s+2 users who use a \s-2@DDD@\s+2
built with LessTif.  See the file `\s-2PROBLEMS\s+2' for a recent list
of problems and fixes.
.\"
.SS "Should I compile @DDD@ myself or should I use an executable?"
Compiling \s-2@DDD@\s+2 on your machine is the preferred way, because
the resulting \s-2@DDD@\s+2 executable will be perfectly adapted to
your system.  However, if your production environment is buggy, or if
you lack the resources for compiling \s-2@DDD@\s+2, a thoroughly
tested precompiled \s-2@DDD@\s+2 executable may be a better choice.
.\"
.\" TOPIC: EVERYDAY PROBLEMS
.SS "How can I display a variable-length array?"
The problem is that \s-2GDB\s+2 does not know the actual length of the
array; you have to supply it by hand (i.e. using the keyboard).  You
can use the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 \*(lqdisplay successive array elements\*(rq
or the \s-2GDB\s+2 \*(lqartificial array\*(rq mechanism.  If you have
a pointer, say:
.sp
.br
  \fBint *pi;\fR
.br
.sp
pointing to an array of 10 ints, you can see the integers by
entering
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display pi[0..9]\fR
.br
.sp
at the debugger prompt (or entering `\fBpi[0..9]\fR` in the `\fBNew
Display\fR' dialog).
.PP
As an alternative, you can use the GDB \*(lqartificial array\*(rq
mechanism by entering
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display pi[0]@10\fR
.br
.sp  
This will create an array starting with \fBpi\fR showing the first 10
elements.
.\"
.SS "My window manager crashes when running @DDD@!"

process; you can define an `\fBInput\fR' handler that will be called
each time the process sends data to you.  The header files of
`\fBTTYAgent\fR' and its superclasses should contain sufficient
information.  As all communication is handled asynchronously, you can
realize a usual Xt-based interface using Athena widgets, Motif
widgets, or another Xt-based toolkit.

both forming class hierarchies whose top classes are defined in
`\fBGraphNode.h\fR' and `\fBGraphEdge.h\fR', respectively.  The graph
nodes in \s-2@DDD@\s+2 are Box graph nodes, defined in

If you find a bug in \s-2@DDD@\s+2, please send us a bug report.  We
will either attempt to fix the bug\(em\&or include the bug description
in the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 `\fBBUGS\fR' file, such that others can attempt
to fix it.  (Instead of sending bug reports, you may also send
\fIfixes\fR; \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is an excellent tool for debugging itself

.\"
Before sending in a bug report, try to find out whether the problem
cause really lies within \s-2@DDD@\s+2.  A common cause of problems
are incomplete or missing X or Motif installations, for instance, or
bugs in the X server or Motif itself.  Running \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as
.br
.sp
  \fB@ddd@ \-\-check-configuration\fR
.sp
.br
checks for common problems and gives hints on how to repair them.
.PP
Another potential cause of problems is the inferior debugger;
occasionally, they show bugs, too.  To find out whether a bug was
caused by the inferior debugger, run \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as
.br
.sp
  \fB@ddd@ \-\-trace\fR
.sp
.br
This shows the interaction between \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and the inferior
debugger on standard error while \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is running.  (This
interaction is also logged in `\fB$HOME/.@ddd@/log\fR'.) Compare the
debugger output to the output of \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and determine which one
is wrong.
.\"
.SS "How to Report Bugs"
.\"
Here are some guidelines for bug reports:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
\fIreport all the facts\fR.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known.  It is not very important what happens
if the bug is already known.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug is not known.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Your bug report should be self-contained.  Do not refer to information
sent in previous mails; your previous mail may have been forwarded to
somebody else.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Please report each bug in a separate message.  This makes it easier
for us to track which bugs have been fixed and to forward your bugs
reports to the appropriate maintainer.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Please report bugs in English; this increases the chances of finding
someone who can fix the bug.  Do not assume one particular person will
receive your bug report.
.br
.PP
.\"
.SS "What to Include in a Bug Report"
.\"
To enable us to fix a \s-2@DDD@\s+2 bug, you \fImust\fR include the
following information:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Your \s-2@DDD@\s+2 configuration.  Invoke \s-2@DDD@\s+2 as
.br
.sp
  \fB@ddd@ \-\-configuration\fR
.sp
.br
to get the configuration information.  If this does not work, please
include at least the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 version, the type of machine you
are using, and its operating system name and version number.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The debugger you are using and its version (e.g., `\fBgdb-4.16\fR' or
`\fBdbx as shipped with Solaris 2.5\fR').
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The compiler you used to compile \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and its version (e.g.,
`\fBgcc-2.8.0\fR').
.br
.IP \(bu 2
A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, \*(lq\s-2@DDD@\s+2 gets a fatal signal\*(rq

data window\*(lq.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
A \fIlog file\fR showing the interaction between \s-2@DDD@\s+2 and the
inferior debugger.  This interaction is logged by default in
`\fB$HOME/.@ddd@/log\fR'.  Include all trace output from the
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 invocation up to the first bug occurrence.

.SH "HISTORY"
.\" ---------------
.\"
The history of \s-2@DDD@\s+2 is a story of code recycling.  The oldest
parts of \s-2@DDD@\s+2 were written in 1990, when \fIAndreas Zeller\fR
designed \s-2VSL\s+2, a box-based visual structure language for
visualizing data and program structures.  The \s-2VSL\s+2 interpreter
and the \s-2BOX\s+2 library became part of Andreas' Diploma Thesis, a
graphical syntax editor based on the Programming System Generator
\s-2PSG\s+2.
.PP
In 1992, the \s-2VSL\s+2 and \s-2BOX\s+2 libraries were recycled for
the \s-2NORA\s+2 project.  For \s-2NORA\s+2, an experimental
inference-based software development tool set, Andreas wrote a graph
editor (based on \s-2VSL\s+2 and the \s-2BOX\s+2 libraries) and
facilities for inter-process knowledge exchange.  Based on these
tools, \fIDorothea Ltkehaus\fR (now \fIDorothea Krabiell\fR) realized
\s-2@DDD@\s+2 as her Diploma Thesis, 1994.
.PP
The original \s-2@DDD@\s+2 had no source window; this was added by
Dorothea during the winter of 1994/1995.  In the first quarter of
1995, finally, Andreas completed \s-2@DDD@\s+2 by adding command and
execution windows, extensions for \s-2DBX\s+2 and remote debugging as
well as configuration support for several architectures.  Since then,
Andreas has further maintained and extended \s-2@DDD@\s+2, based on
the comments and suggestions of several \s-2@DDD@\s+2 users around the 
world.  See the comments in the \s-2@DDD@\s+2 source for details.
