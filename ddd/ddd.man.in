.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.\" ---------------
.\"
The purpose of a debugger such as \s-1@DDD@\s+1 is to allow you to see
what is going on \*(lqinside\*(rq another program while it
executes\(em\&or what another program was doing at the moment it
crashed.
.PP
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
.IP \(bu 2
Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
behavior.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Make your program stop on specified conditions.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
.PP
.\"
\*(lqClassical\*(rq \s-1UNIX\s+1 debuggers such as the \s-1GNU\s+1
debugger (\s-1GDB\s+1) provide a command-line interface and a
multitude of commands for these and other debugging purposes.
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 is a comfortable \fIgraphical user interface\fR around
an inferior \s-1GDB\s+1, \s-1DBX\s+1, \s-1XDB\s+1, or \s-1JDB\s+1
debugger.
.\"
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "INVOKING @DDD@"
.\" ---------------
.\"
You can run \s-1@DDD@\s+1 with no arguments or options.  However, the
most usual way to start \s-1@DDD@\s+1 is with one argument or two,
specifying an executable program as the argument:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\ core\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want
to debug a running process:
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ program\ 1234\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
would attach \s-1@DDD@\s+1 to process \c
.B 1234\c
\& (unless you also have a file
named `\|\c
.B 1234\c
\&\|'; \s-1@DDD@\s+1 does check for a core file first).
.\"
.PP
By default, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 uses \s-1GDB\s+1 as inferior debugger.  Use
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-dbx \fIprogram\fR
.br
.sp
or
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-xdb \fIprogram\fR
.br
.sp
or
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-jdb \fIclass\fR
.br
.sp
.\"
to run \s-1DBX\s+1 or \s-1XDB\s+1 or \s-1JDB\s+1 as inferior debugger.
.PP
To learn more about \s-1@DDD@\s+1 options, run
.sp
.br
  \fB@ddd@\ \-\-help\fR
.br
.sp
to get a list of frequently used options, or see the `\fBOPTIONS\fR'
section, below.

.SH "THE @DDD@ WINDOWS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.SS "The @DDD@ Main Windows"
.\"
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-all.ps 15.3cm
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 is composed of three main windows:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIData Window\fR shows the current data of the debugged program.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fISource Window\fR shows the current source code of the debugged
program.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIDebugger Console\fR accepts debugger commands and shows
debugger messages.
.PP
By default, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 places these main windows stacked into one
single top-level window, but \s-1@DDD@\s+1 can also be configured to
treat each one separately.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-separate.ps 15.3cm
.PP
Besides these main windows, there are some other optional windows
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fICommand Tool\fR offers buttons for frequently used commands.
It is usually placed on the source window.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIMachine Code Window\fR shows the current machine code.  It is
usually placed beneath the current source.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIExecution Window\fR shows the input and output of the debugged
program.
.PP
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 also has several temporary \fIdialogs\fR for showing and
entering additional information.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Using the Command Tool"
.\"
The command tool is a small window containing frequently used
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 commands.  It can be moved around on top of the
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 windows, but it can also be placed besides them.
Whenever you save \s-1@DDD@\s+1 state, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 also saves the
distance between command tool and source window, such that you can
select your own individual command tool placement.  To move the
command tool to its saved position, use `\fBView\(->Command Tool\fR'.
.PP
By default, the command tool \fIsticks\fR to the \s-1@DDD@\s+1 source
window: Whenever you move the \s-1@DDD@\s+1 source window, the command
tool follows such that the distance between source window and command
tool remains the same.  By default, the command tool is also
\fIauto-raised\fR, such that it stays on top of other \s-1@DDD@\s+1
windows.
.PP
The command tool can be configured to appear as a command tool bar
above the source window; see `\fBEdit\(->Preferences\(->Source\(->Tool
Buttons Location\fR' for details.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-tool.ps 15.3cm
.\"
.\"
.SS "Using the Tool Bar"
.\"
Some \s-1@DDD@\s+1 commands require an \fIargument\fR.  This argument
is specified in the \fIargument field\fR, labeled `\fB():\fR'.
Basically, there are four ways to set arguments:
.IP \(bu 2
You can \fIkey in\fR the argument manually.
.IP \(bu 2
You can \fIpaste\fR the current selection into the argument field
(typically using \fImouse button 2\fR).  To clear old contents
beforehand, click on the `\fB():\fR' label.
.IP \(bu 2
You can \fIselect an item\fR from the source and data windows.  This
will automatically copy the item to the argument field.
.IP \(bu 2
You can select a \fIpreviously used argument\fR from the drop-down
menu at the right of the argument field.
.PP
Using \s-1GDB\s+1, the argument field provides a completion mechanism.
You can enter the first few characters of an item an press the
`\s-1TAB\s+1' key to complete it.  Pressing `\s-1TAB\s+1' again
shows alternative completions.
.PP
After having entered an argument, you can select one of the buttons on
the right.  Most of these buttons also have menus associated with
them; this is indicated by a small arrow in the upper right corner.
Pressing and holding \fImouse button 1\fR on such a button will pop up
a menu with further operations.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-toolbar.ps 15.3cm

.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "GETTING HELP"
.\" ---------------
.\"
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 has an extensive on-line help system.  Here's how to get 
help while working with \s-1@DDD@\s+1.
.\"
.SS "Button Tips"
.\"
You can get a short help text on most \s-1@DDD@\s+1 buttons by simply
moving the mouse pointer on it and leave it there.  After a second, a
small window (called \fIbutton tip\fR) pops up, giving a hint on the
button's meaning.  The button tip disappears as soon as you move the
mouse pointer to another item.
.\"
.SS "The Status Line"
.\"
The status line also displays information about the currently selected
item.  By clicking on the status line, you can redisplay the most
recent messages.
.\"
.SS "Context-Sensitive Help"
.\"
You can get detailed help on any visible \s-1@DDD@\s+1 item.  Just
point on the item you want help and press the `\fBF1\fR' key.  This
pops up a detailed help text.
.PP
The \s-1@DDD@\s+1 dialogs all contain `\fBHelp\fR' buttons that give
detailed information about the dialog.
.\"
.SS "Help on Debugger Commands"
.\"
You can get help on debugger commands by entering `\fBhelp\fR' at the
debugger prompt.
.PP
See `\fBEntering Commands\fR', below, for details on entering commands.
.\"
.SS "Are You Stuck?"
.\"
In case you're stuck, try `\fBHelp\(->What Now?\fR' (the `\fBWhat
Now\fR' item in the `\fBHelp\fR' menu) or press \fBCtrl+F1\fR.
Depending on the current state, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 will give you some hints
on what you can do.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "OPENING FILES"
.\" ---------------
.\"
If you did not invoke \s-1@DDD@\s+1 specifying a program to be debugged,
you can use the `\fBFile\fR' menu to open programs, core dumps and
sources.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-open.ps 15.3cm
.PP
To open a program to be debugged, select `\fBFile\(->Open Program\fR'.
.PP
In \s-1JDB\s+1, select `\fBFile\(->Open Class\fR' instead.  This gives
you a list of available classes to choose from.
.PP
To re-open a recently debugged program or class, select
`\fBFile\(->Open Recent\fR' and choose a program or class from the
list.
.PP
Note: With \s-1XDB\s+1 and some \s-1DBX\s+1 versions, the debugged
program must be specified upon invocation and cannot be changed at run
time.
.PP
To open a core dump for the program, select `\fBFile\(->Open Core
Dump\fR'.  Before `\fBOpen Core Dump\fR', you should first use
`\fBFile\(->Open Program\fR' to specify the program that generated the
core dump and to load its symbol table.
.PP
To open a source file of the debugged program, select `\fBFile\(->Open
Source\fR'.
.IP \(bu 2
Using \s-1GDB\s+1, this gives you a list of the sources used for
compiling your program.
.IP \(bu 2
Using other inferior debuggers, this gives you a list of accessible
source files, which may or may not be related to your program.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "LOOKING UP ITEMS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
As soon as the source of the debugged program is available, the
\fIsource window\fR displays its current source text.  (If a source
text cannot be found, use `\fBEdit\(->GDB Settings\fR' to specify
source text directories.)
.PP
In the source window, you can lookup and examine function and variable
definitions as well as search for arbitrary occurrences in the source
text.
.\"
.SS "Looking up Definitions"
.\"
If you wish to lookup a specific function or variable definition whose
name is visible in the source text, click with \fImouse button 1\fR on
the function or variable name.  The name is copied to the argument
field.  Alter the name if desired and click on the `\fBLookup ()\fR'
button to find its definition.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-source-popup.ps 15.3cm
.PP
As a faster alternative, you can simply press \fImouse button 3\fR on the
function name and select the `\fBLookup\fR' item from the source popup
menu.
.PP
As an even faster alternative, you can also double-click on a function 
call (an identifier followed by a `\fB(\fR' character) to lookup the
function definition.
.\"
.SS "Textual Search"
.\"
If the item you wish to search is visible in the source text, click
with \fImouse button 1\fR on it.  The identifier is copied to the argument
field.  Click on the `\fBFind\s-1>>\s+1 ()\fR' button to find
following occurrences and on the `\fBFind\s-1<<\s+1 ()\fR' button to
find previous occurrences.
.PP
As an alternative, you can enter the item in the argument field and
click on one of the `\fBFind\fR' buttons.
.PP
By default, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 finds only complete words.  To search for
arbitrary substrings, change the value of the `\fBSource\(->Find Words
Only\fR' option.
.\"
.SS "Looking up Previous Locations"
.\"
Use the `\fBBack\fR' and `\fBForward\fR' buttons to lookup previous or
next locations.  The location found is underlined.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-source.ps 15.3cm
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "BREAKPOINTS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
You can make the program stop at certain \fIbreakpoints\fR and trace
its execution.
.\"
.SS "Setting Breakpoints by Location"
.\"
If the source line is visible, click with \fImouse button 1\fR
on the left of the source line and then on the `\fBBreak at ()\fR'
button.
.PP
As a faster alternative, you can simply press \fImouse button 3\fR on
the left of the source line and select the `\fBSet Breakpoint\fR' item
from the line popup menu.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-line-popup.ps 15.3cm
.PP
As an even faster alternative, you can sinply double-click on the left
of the source line to set a breakpoint.
.PP
As yet another alternative, you can select `\fBSource\(->Edit
Breakpoints\fR'.  Click on the `\fBBreak\fR' button and enter the
location.
.PP
(If you find this number of alternatives confusing, be aware that
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 users fall into three categories, which must all be
supported.  \fINovice users\fR explore \s-1@DDD@\s+1 and may prefer to
use one single mouse button.  \fIAdvanced users\fR know how to use
shortcuts and prefer popup menus.  \fIExperienced users\fR prefer the
command line interface.)
.PP
Breakpoints are indicated by a plain stop sign, or as
`\fB#\fIn\fB#\fR', where \fIn\fR is the breakpoint number.  A greyed
out stop sign (or `\fB_\fIn\fB_\fR') indicates a disabled breakpoint.
A stop sign with a question mark (or `\fB?\fIn\fB?\fR') indicates a
conditional breakpoint or a breakpoint with an ignore count set.
.PP
Note: We have received reports that some Motif versions fail to
display stop signs correctly.  If this happens, try writing in your
`\fB$HOME/.@ddd@/init\fR' file:
.br
.sp
  \fB@Ddd@*cacheGlyphImages: off\fR
.sp
.br
and restart \s-1@DDD@\s+1.  See also the `\fBcacheGlyphImages\fR'
resource in the `\fBRESOURCES\fR' section, below.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Setting Breakpoints by Name"
.\"
If the function name is visible, click with \fImouse button 1\fR on the
function name.  The function name is copied to the argument field.
Click on the `\fBBreak at ()\fR' button to set a breakpoint there.
.PP
As a shorter alternative, you can simply press \fImouse button 3\fR on the
function name and select the `\fBbreak\fR' item from the popup menu.
.PP
As yet another alternative, you can click on `\fBNew\fR' from the
Breakpoint editor (invoked through `\fBSource\(->Edit Breakpoints\fR')
and enter the function name.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Setting Regexp Breakpoints"
.\"
Using \s-1GDB\s+1, you can also set a breakpoint on all functions that
match a given string.  `\fBBreak at ()\(->Set Breakpoints at Regexp
()\fR' sets a breakpoint on all functions whose name matches the
\fIregular expression\fR given in `\fB()\fR'.  Here are some examples:
.IP \(bu 2
To set a breakpoint on every function that starts with `\fBXm\fR', set
`\fB()\fR' to `\fB^Xm\fR'.
.IP \(bu 2
To set a breakpoint on every member of class `\fBDate\fR', set
`\fB()\fR' to `\fB^Date::\fR'.
.IP \(bu 2
To set a breakpoint on every function whose name contains
`\fB_fun\fR', set `\fB()\fR' to `\fB_fun\fR'.
.IP \(bu 2
To set a breakpoint on every function that ends in `\fB_test\fR', 
set `\fB()\fR' to `\fB_test$\fR'.
.PP
Once these multiple breakpoints are set, they are treated just like
the breakpoints set with the `\fBBreak at ()\fR' button.  You can
delete them, disable them, or make them conditional the same way as
any other breakpoint.  Use `\fBSource\(->Edit Breakpoints\fR' to view
and edit the list of breakpoints.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Disabling Breakpoints"
.\"
To temporarily disable a breakpoint, press \fImouse button 3\fR on the
breakpoint symbol and select the `\fBDisable Breakpoint\fR' item from
the breakpoint popup menu.  To enable it again, select `\fBEnable
Breakpoint\fR'.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-bp-popup.ps 15.3cm
.PP
As an alternative, you can select the breakpoint and click on
`\fBDisable\fR' or `\fBEnable\fR' in the Breakpoint editor (invoked
through `\fBSource\(->Edit Breakpoints\fR'.
.PP
Disabled breakpoints are indicated by a grey stop sign, or 
`\fB_\fIn\fB_\fR', where \fIn\fR is the breakpoint number.
.PP
The `\fBDisable Breakpoint\fR' item is also accessible via the
`\fBClear at ()\fR' button.  Just press and hold \fImouse button 1\fR
on the button to get a popup menu.
.PP
Note: \s-1JDB\s+1 does not support breakpoint disabling.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Temporary Breakpoints"
.\"
A \fItemporary breakpoint\fR is immediately deleted as soon as it is
reached.  To set a temporary breakpoint, press \fImouse button 3\fR on the
left of the source line and select the `\fBSet Temporary
Breakpoint\fR' item from the popup menu.
.PP
Temporary breakpoints are convenient to make the program continue up
to a specific location: just set the temporary breakpoint at this
location and continue execution.
.PP
The `\fBContinue Until Here\fR' item from the popup menu sets a
temporary breakpoint on the left of the source line and immediately
continues execution.  Execution stops when the temporary breakpoint is
reached.
.PP
The `\fBSet Temporary Breakpoint\fR' and `\fBContinue Until Here\fR'
items are also accessible via the `\fBBreak at ()\fR' button.  Just
press and hold \fImouse button 1\fR on the button to get a popup menu.
.PP
Note: \s-1JDB\s+1 does not support temporary breakpoints.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Deleting Breakpoints"
.\"
If the breakpoint is visible, click with \fImouse button 1\fR on the
breakpoint.  The breakpoint location is copied to the argument field.
Click on the `\fBClear at ()\fR' button to delete all breakpoints
there.
.PP
If the function name is visible, click with \fImouse button 1\fR on the
function name.  The function name is copied to the argument field.
Click on the `\fBClear at ()\fR' button to set a breakpoint there.

As yet another alternative, you can select the breakpoint and click on
`\fBDelete\fR' in the Breakpoint editor (invoked through
`\fBSource\(->Edit Breakpoints\fR').
.\"
.\"
.SS "Editing Breakpoint Properties"
.\"
You can change all properties of a breakpoint by pressing \fImouse
button 3\fR on the breakpoint symbol and select `\fBProperties\fR'
from the breakpoint popup menu.  This will pop up a dialog showing the 
current properties of the selected breakpoint.
.PP
As an even faster alternative, you can sinply double-click on the

.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS "Breakpoint Conditions"
.\"
In the field `\fBCondition\fR' of the `\fBBreakpoint Properties\fR'
panel, you can specify a \fIbreakpoint condition\fR.  If a breakpoint
condition is set, the breakpoint stops the program only if the
associated condition is met\(em\&that is, if the condition expression
evaluates to a non-zero value.
.PP
Note: \s-1JDB\s+1 does not support breakpoint conditions.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Breakpoint Ignore Counts"
.\"
In the field `\fBIgnore Count\fR' of the `\fBBreakpoint Properties\fR'
panel, you can specify a \fIbreakpoint ignore count\fR.  If the ignore
count is set to some value \fIN\fR, the next \fIN\fR crossings of the
breakpoint will be ignored: Each crossing of the breakpoint decrements
the ignore count; the program stops only if the ignore count is zero.
.PP
Note: \s-1JDB\s+1 and some \s-1DBX\s+1 variants do not support
breakpoint ignore counts.
.\"
.SS "Breakpoint Commands"
.\"
Note: Breakpoint commands are currently available on \s-1GDB\s+1 only.
.PP
Using the `\fBCommands\fR' buttons of the `\fBBreakpoint
Properties\fR' panel, you can record and edit commands to be executed
when the breakpoint is hit.
.PP
To record a command sequence, follow these steps:
.IP \(bu 2
Click on `\fBRecord\fR' to begin the recording of the breakpoint commands.
.IP \(bu 2
Now interact with \s-1DDD\s+1.  While recording, \s-1DDD\s+1 does not
execute commands, but simply records them to be executed when the
breakpoint is hit.  The recorded debugger commands are shown in the
debugger console.
.IP \(bu 2
To stop the recording, click on `\fBEnd\fR' or enter `\fBend\fR' at
the \s-1GDB\s+1 prompt.  To \fIcancel\fR the recording, click on
`\fBInterrupt\fR' or press \fBEsc\fR.
.IP \(bu 2
Click on `\fBEdit \s-1>>\s+1\fR' to edit the recorded commands.
When done with editing, click on `\fBEdit \s-1<<\s+1\fR' to close the
commands editor.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS "Moving and Copying Breakpoints"
.\"
To move a breakpoint to a different location, press \fImouse button 1\fR on
the stop sign and drag it to the desired location.  This is equivalent
to deleting the breakpoint at the old location and setting a
breakpoint at the new location.  The new breakpoint inherits all
properties of the old breakpoint, except the breakpoint number.
.PP
To copy a breakpoint to a new location, press the \fBShift\fR key
while dragging.
.PP
Note: Dragging breakpoints is not possible when glyphs are disabled.
Delete and set breakpoints instead.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Looking up Breakpoints"
.\"
If you wish to lookup a specific breakpoint, select `\fBSource\(->Edit
Breakpoints\(->Lookup\fR'.  After selecting a breakpoint from the list
and clicking the `\fBLookup\fR' button, the breakpoint location is
displayed.
.PP
As an alternative, you can enter `\fB#\fIn\fR' in the argument field,
where \fIn\fR is the breakpoint number and click on the `\fBLookup ()\fR'
button to find its definition.

.SS "More Breakpoint Features"
.\"
Using \s-1GDB\s+1, a few more commands related to breakpoints can be
invoked through the debugger console:
.TP 10
.B "hbreak \fIposition\fR"
Sets a hardware-assisted breakpoint at \fIposition\fR.  This command
requires hardware support and some target hardware may not have this
support.  The main purpose of this is EPROM/ROM code debugging, so you
can set a breakpoint at an instruction without changing the
instruction.
.TP 10
.B "thbreak \fIpos\fR"
Set a temporary hardware-assisted breakpoint at \fIpos\fR.
.PP
See the \s-1GDB\s+1 documentation for details on these commands.
.\"
.\"
.\" ---------------
.SH "WATCHPOINTS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
You can make the program stop as soon as some variable value changes,
or when some variable is read or written.  This is called `setting a
\fIwatchpoint\fR on a variable'.
.PP
Watchpoints have much in common with breakpoints: in particular, you
can enable and disable them.  You can also set conditions, ignore
counts, and commands to be executed when a watched variable changes
its value.
.PP
Please note: on architectures without special watchpoint support,
watchpoints currently make the program execute two orders of magnitude
more slowly.  This is so because the inferior debugger must interrupt
the program after each machine instruction in order to examine whether
the watched value has changed.  However, this delay can be well worth
it to catch errors when you have no clue what part of your program is
the culprit.
.PP
Note: Watchpoints are available in \s-1GDB\s+1 and some \s-1DBX\s+1
variants only.  In \s-1XDB\s+1, a similar feature is available via
\s-1XDB\s+1 \fIassertions\fR; see the \s-1XDB\s+1 documentation for
details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Setting Watchpoints"
.\"
If the variable name is visible, click with \fImouse button 1\fR on
the variable name.  The variable name is copied to the argument field.
Otherwise, enter the variable name in the argument field.  Click on
the `\fBWatch ()\fR' button to set a watchpoint there.
.PP
Using \s-1GDB\s+1, you can set different types of watchpoints.  Click
and hold \fImouse button 1\fR on the `\fBWatch ()\fR' button to get a
menu.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Editing Watchpoint Properties"
.\"
To change the properties of a watchpoint, enter the name of the
watched variable in the argument field.  Click and hold \fImouse
button 1\fR on the `\fBWatch ()\fR' button and select `\fBWatchpoint
Properties\fR'.
.PP
The \fBWatchpoint Properties\fR panel has the same functionality as
the \fBBreakpoint Properties\fR panel; see `\fBEditing Breakpoint
Properties\fR', above, for details.  As an additional feature, you can 
click on `\fBPrint ()\fR' to see the current value of a watched
variable.

.\" ---------------
.\"
.SS "Starting Program Execution"
.\"
To start execution of the debugged program, select
`\fBProgram\(->Run\fR'.  You will then be prompted for the arguments
to pass to your program.  You can either select from a list of
previously used arguments or enter own arguments in the text field.
Afterwards, press the `\fBOK\fR' button to start execution with the
selected arguments.
.PP
To run your program again, with the same arguments, select
`\fBProgram\(->Run Again\fR' or press the `\fBRun\fR' button on the
command tool.  You may also enter `\fBrun\fR', followed by arguments
at the debugger prompt instead.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-arguments.ps 15.3cm
.\"
.SS "Using the Execution Window"
.PP
By default, input and output of your program go to the debugger
console.  As an alternative, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 can also invoke an
\fIexecution window\fR, where the program terminal input and output is
shown.  To activate the execution window, select `\fBProgram\(->Run in
Execution Window\fR'.
.PP
While the execution window is active, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 invokes your
program such that its standard input, output, and error streams are
redirected to the execution window.  Note that the device
`\fB/dev/tty\fR' still refers to the debugger console, \fInot\fR the
execution window.
.PP
You can override the \s-1@DDD@\s+1 stream redirection by giving
alternate redirection operations as arguments.  For instance, to have
your program read from a file, but to write ro the execution window,
invoke your program with `\fB< \fIfile\fR' as argument.  Likewise, to
redirect the standard error output to the debugger console, use `\fB2>
/dev/tty\fR' (assuming the inferior debugger and/or your \s-1UNIX\s+1
shell support standard error redirection).
.PP
The execution window is not available in \s-1JDB\s+1, since
\s-1JDB\s+1 does not support redirection.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Attaching to a Running Process"
.\"
If the debugged program is already running in some process, you can
\fIattach\fR to this process (instead of starting a new one with
`\fBRun\fR').  Select `\fBFile\(->Attach to Process\fR' to choose from
a list of processes.  Afterwards, press the `\fBAttach\fR' button to
attach to the specified process.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-attach.ps 15.3cm
.PP
The first thing \s-1@DDD@\s+1 does after arranging to debug the
specified process is to stop it. You can examine and modify an
attached process with all the \s-1@DDD@\s+1 commands that are
ordinarily available when you start processes with `\fBRun\fR'. You
can insert breakpoints; you can step and continue; you can modify
storage. If you would rather the process continue running, you may use
`\fBContinue\fR' after attaching \s-1@DDD@\s+1 to the process.
.PP
When using `\fBAttach to Process\fR', you should first use `\fBOpen
Program\fR' to specify the program running in the process and load its
symbol table.
.PP
When you have finished debugging the attached process, you can use the
`\fBFile\(->Detach Process\fR' to release it from \s-1@DDD@\s+1
control.  Detaching the process continues its execution.  After
`\fBDetach Process\fR', that process and \s-1@DDD@\s+1 become
completely independent once more, and you are ready to attach another
process or start one with `\fBRun\fR'.
.PP
You can customize the list of processes shown by defining an alternate
command to list processes.  See
`\fBEdit\(->Preferences\(->Helpers\(->List Processes\fR'.
.PP
Note: \s-1JDB\s+1 does not support attaching to processes.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Stopping the Program"
.\"
The program stops as soon as a breakpoint is reached.  The current
execution position is highlighted by an arrow.
.PP
You can interrupt a running program any time by clicking the
`\fBInterrupt\fR' button or typing \fBEsc\fR in a \s-1@DDD@\s+1
window.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Resuming Execution"
.\"
To resume execution, at the address where your program last stopped,
click on the `\fBContinue\fR` button.  Any breakpoints set at that
address are bypassed.
.PP
To execute just one source line, click on the `\fBStep\fR' button.
The program is executed until control reaches a different source line,
which may be in a different function.
.PP
To continue to the next line in the current function, click on the
`\fBNext\fR' button.  This is similar to `\fBStep\fR', but any
function calls appearing within the line of code are executed without
stopping.
.PP
To continue running until the current function returns, use the
`\fBFinish\fR' button.  The returned value (if any) is printed.
.PP
To continue running until a line after the current source line is
reached, use the `\fBContinue Until Here\fR' facility from the line
popup menu.  See the `\fBTemporary Breakpoints\fR' section, above, for
a discussion.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SS "Altering the Execution Position"
.\"
To resume execution at a different location, press \fImouse button 1\fR on
the arrow and drag it to a different location.  The most common
occasion to use this feature is to back up\(em\&perhaps with more
breakpoints set-over a portion of a program that has already executed,
in order to examine its execution in more detail.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-drag.ps 15.3cm
.PP
Moving the execution position does not change the current stack frame,
or the stack pointer, or the contents of any memory location or any
register other than the program counter.
.PP
Some inferior debuggers (notably \s-1GDB\s+1) allow you to set the new
execution position into a different function from the one currently
executing.  This may lead to bizarre results if the two functions
expect different patterns of arguments or of local variables.  For
this reason, moving the execution position requests confirmation if
the specified line is not in the function currently executing.
.PP
After moving the execution position, click on the `\fBContinue\fR'
button to resume execution.
.PP
Note: Dragging the execution position is not possible when glyphs are
disabled.  Use `\fBSet Execution Position\fR' from the breakpoint
popup menu instead to set the execution position to the current
location.  This item is also accessible by pressing and holding the
`\fBBreak at ()\fR/\fBClear at ()\fR' button.
.PP
Note: \s-1JDB\s+1 does not support altering the execution position.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Examining the Stack"
.\"
When your program has stopped, the first thing you need to know is
where it stopped and how it got there.
.PP
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 provides a \fIbacktrace window\fR showing a summary of 
how your program got where it is.  To enable the backtrace window,
select `\fBStatus\(->Backtrace\fR'.
.PP
The `\fBUp\fR' button selects the function that called the current
one.
.PP
The `\fBDown\fR' button selects the function that was called by
the current one.
.PP
You can also directly type the `\fBup\fR' and `\fBdown\fR' commands at
the debugger prompt.  Typing \fBCtrl+Up\fR and \fBCtrl+Down\fR,
respectively, will also move you through the stack.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-backtrace.ps 15.3cm

.\"
.SS "Examining Threads"
.\"
Note: Thread support is available with \s-1GDB\s+1 and \s-1JDB\s+1 only.
.PP
In some operating systems, a single program may have more than one
\fIthread\fR of execution.  The precise semantics of threads differ
from one operating system to another, but in general the threads of a
single program are akin to multiple processes\(em\&except that they
share one address space (that is, they can all examine and modify the
same variables).  On the other hand, each thread has its own registers
and execution stack, and perhaps private memory.
.PP
For debugging purposes, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 lets you display the list of
threads currently active in your program and lets you select the
\fIcurrent thread\fR\(em\&the thread which is the focus of debugging.
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 shows all program information from the perspective of
the current thread.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-threads.ps 15.3cm
.PP
To view all currently active threads in your program, select
`\fBStatus\(->Threads\fR'.  The current thread is highlighted.  Select
any thread to make it the current thread.
.PP
Using \s-1JDB\s+1, additional functionality is available:
.IP \(bu 2
Select a \fIthreadgroup\fR to switch between viewing all threads and
the threads of the selected threadgroup;
.IP \(bu 2
Click on `\fBSuspend\fR' to suspend execution of the selected threads;
.IP \(bu 2
Click on `\fBResume\fR' to resume execution of the selected threads.
.PP
For more information on threads, see the \s-1JDB\s+1 and \s-1GDB\s+2
documentation.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Handling Signals"
.\"
Note: Signal support is available with \s-1GDB\s+1 only.
.PP
A signal is an asynchronous event that can happen in a program.  The
operating system defines the possible kinds of signals, and gives each
kind a name and a number.  For example, in Unix \fBSIGINT\fR is the
signal a program gets when you type an interrupt; \fBSIGSEGV\fR is the
signal a program gets from referencing a place in memory far away from
all the areas in use; \fBSIGALRM\fR occurs when the alarm clock timer
goes off (which happens only if your program has requested an alarm).
.PP
Some signals, including \fBSIGALRM\fR, are a normal part of the
functioning of your program.  Others, such as \fBSIGSEGV\fR, indicate
errors; these signals are \fIfatal\fR (kill your program immediately)
if the program has not specified in advance some other way to handle
the signal.  \fBSIGINT\fR does not indicate an error in your program,
but it is normally fatal so it can carry out the purpose of the
interrupt: to kill the program.
.PP
\s-1GDB\s+2 has the ability to detect any occurrence of a signal in
your program.  You can tell \s-1GDB\s+1 in advance what to do for each
kind of signal.
.PP
Normally, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 is set up to ignore non-erroneous signals like
\fBSIGALRM\fR (so as not to interfere with their role in the
functioning of your program) but to stop your program immediately
whenever an error signal happens.  In \s-1@DDD@\s+1, you can change
these settings via `\fBStatus\(->Signals\fR'.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-signals.ps 15.3cm
.PP
`\fBStatus\(->Signals\fR' pops up a panel showing all the kinds of
signals and how \s-1GDB\s+1 has been told to handle each one.  The
settings available for each signal are:
.TP 10
.B "Stop"
If set, \s-1GDB\s+1 should stop your program when this signal happens.
This also implies `\fBPrint\fR' being set.
.sp
If unset, \s-1GDB\s+1 should not stop your program when this signal
happens.  It may still print a message telling you that the signal has
come in.
.TP 10
.B "Print"
If set, \s-1GDB\s+1 should print a message when this signal happens.
.sp
If unset, \s-1GDB\s+1 should not mention the occurrence of the signal
at all.  This also implies `\fBStop\fR' being unset.
.TP 10
.B "Pass"
If set, \s-1GDB\s+1 should allow your program to see this signal; your
program can handle the signal, or else it may terminate if the signal
is fatal and not handled.
.sp
If unset, \s-1GDB\s+1 should not allow your program to see this
signal.
.PP
When a signal stops your program, the signal is not visible until you
continue.  Your program sees the signal then, if `\fBPass\fR' is in
effect for the signal in question \fIat that time\fR.  In other words,
after \s-1GDB\s+1 reports a signal, you can change the
`\fBStatus\(->Signals\fR' `\fBPass\fR' setting to control whether your
program sees that signal when you continue.
.PP
You can also cause your program to see a signal it normally would not
see, or to give it any signal at any time.  The `\fBSend\fR' button
will resume execution where your program stopped, but immediately give
it the signal shown.
.PP
On the other hand, you can also prevent your program from seeing a
signal.  For example, if your program stopped due to some sort of
memory reference error, you might store correct values into the
erroneous variables and continue, hoping to see more execution; but
your program would probably terminate immediately as a result of the
fatal signal once it saw the signal.  To prevent this, you can
resume execution using `\fBCommands\(->Continue Without Signal\fR'.
.PP
`\fBEdit\(->Save Options\fR' does not save changed signal settings,
since changed signal settings are normally useful within specific
projects only.  Instead, signal settings are saved with the current
session, using `\fBFile\(->Save Session As\fR'.

line; after a second, a popup window shows the variable value.  This
is useful for quick examination of several simple variables.
.TP 10
.B "Printing Values"
If you want to reuse variable values at a later time, you can print
the value in the debugger console.  This allows for displaying and
examining larger data structures.
.TP 10
.B "Displaying Values"
If you want to examine complex data structures, you can display them
graphically in the data display.  Displays remain effective until you
delete them; they are updated each time the program stops.  This is
useful for large dynamic structures.
.TP 10
.B "Memory Dumps"
This feature, available using \s-1GDB\s+1 only, allows you to dump

.PP
The `\fBOther\fR' entry in the shortcut menu lets you create a new
display that \fIextends\fR the shortcut menu.  As an example, assume
you have selected a display named `\fBdate_ptr\fR'.  Selecting
`\fBDisplay\(->Other\fR' pops up a dialog that allows you to enter a

display `\fBdate_ptr\fR' to a new display `\fB(char *)date_ptr\fR'.
If the `\fBInclude in `\fBNew Display\fR' Menu\fR' toggle was
activated, the shortcut menu will then contain a new entry `\fBDisplay
(char *)()\fR' that will cast \fIany\fR selected display \fIdisplay\fR

You can display all local variables at once by choosing
`\fBData\(->Display Local Variables\fR'.  When using \s-1DBX\s+1,
\s-1XDB\s+1, or \s-1JDB\s+1, this displays all local variables,
including the arguments of the current function.  When using
\s-1GDB\s+1, function arguments are contained in a separate display,
activated by `\fBDisplay Arguments\fR'.
.PP
The display showing the local variables can be manipulated just like
any other data display.  Individual variables can be selected and
dereferenced.
.PP

.\"
.SS "Displaying Program Status"
.\"
Besides local variables, you can create a display from the output of
an arbitrary debugger command.  By entering
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display `\fIcommand\fB`\fR
.sp
.br
the output of \fIcommand\fR is turned into a \fIstatus display\fR
updated each time the program stops.  For instance, by entering
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display `where`\fR
.sp
.br
a status display named `\fBWhere\fR' is created that shows the current
backtrace.
.PP
If you are using \s-1GDB\s+1, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 provides a panel from
which you can choose useful status displays.  Select
`\fBData\(->Status Displays\fR' and pick your choice from the list.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-status-displays.ps 15.3cm

Note that status displays are quite time-consuming, so you
should delete them as soon as you don't need them any more.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Displaying Multiple Array Values"
.\"
When debugging C or C++ programs, one often has to deal with pointers
to arrays of dynamically determined size.  Both \s-1@DDD@\s+1 and
\s-1GDB\s+1 provide special support for such dynamic arrays.
.PP
To display several successive objects of the same type (a section of
an array, or an array of dynamically determined size), use the
notation \fB[\fIFROM\fB..\fITO\fB]\fR in display expressions.
\fIFROM\fR and \fITO\fR denote the first and last array position to
display.  Thus,
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display argv[0..9]\fR
.sp
.br
creates ten new display nodes for `\fBargv[0]\fR',
`\fBargv[1]\fR', ..., `\fBargv[9]\fR'.
.PP
Using \s-1GDB\s+1 as inferior debugger, you can use \fIartificial arrays\fR.
Typing
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph display argv[0] @ 10\fR
.sp
.br
creates a single array display node containing `\fBargv[0]\fR' up to
`\fBargv[9]\fR'.  Generally, by using the `\fB@\fR' operator, you
can specify the number of array elements to be displayed.
.PP
For more details on artificial arrays, see the \s-1GDB\s+1 documentation.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Repeated Array Values"
.\"
Using \s-1GDB\s+1, an array value that is repeated 10 or more times is
displayed only once.  The value is shown with a `\fB<\fIN\fB\(mu>\fR'
postfix added, where \fIN\fR is the number of times the value is
repeated.  Thus, the display `\fB0x0 <30\(mu>\fR' stands for 30 array
elements, each with the value \fB0x0\fR.  This saves a lot of display
space, especially with homogeneous arrays.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-repeats.ps 15.3cm
.PP
The default \s-1GDB\s+1 threshold for repeated array values is 10.
You can change it via `\fBEdit\(->GDB Settings\(->Threshold for
repeated print elements\fR'.  Setting the threshold to \fB0\fR will
cause \s-1GDB\s+1 (and \s-1@DDD@\s+1) to display each array element
individually.  Be sure to refresh the data window via
`\fBData\(->Refresh Displays\fR' after a change in \s-1GDB\s+1
settings.
.PP
You can also configure \s-1@DDD@\s+1 to display each array element
individually, regardless of \s-1GDB\s+1 settings; see the
`\fBexpandRepeatedValues\fR' resource for details.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Altering Variable Values"
.\"
Using the `\fBSet ()\fR' button or the `\fBSet Value\fR' menu item in
the data popup menu, you can alter the value of the selected variable,
to resume execution with the changed value.  In a dialog, you can
modify the variable value at will; clicking the `\fBOK\fR' or
`\fBApply\fR' button commits your change.
.PP
Note that most inferior debuggers have no support for changing entire
structures; you must change each primitive structure member
separately.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-set.ps 15.3cm
.PP
Note: Altering variable values is not supported in \s-1JDB\s+1.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Refreshing the Data Window"
.\"
The data window refreshes itself automatically each time the program
stops.  Values that have changed are highlighted.
.PP
However, there may be situations where you should refresh the data
window explicitly.  This is especially the case whenever you changed
debugger settings that could affect the data format, and want the data 
window to reflect these settings.
.PP
You can refresh the data window by selecting `\fBData\(->Refresh
Displays\fR'.
.PP
As an alternative, you can press \fImouse button 3\fR on the background of
the data window and select the `\fBRefresh Display\fR' item.
.PP
Typing
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph refresh\fR
.sp
.br
at the debugger prompt has the same effect.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Deleting Displays"
.\"
To delete a single display, select it and click on the `\fBDelete
()\fR' button.  As an alternative, you can also press \fImouse button 3\fR on
the display and select the `\fBDelete Display\fR' item.
.PP
When a display is deleted, its immediate ancestors and descendants are
automatically selected, so that you can easily delete entire graphs.
.PP
To delete several displays at once, select the `\fBDelete\fR' item in
the Display Editor (invoked via `\fBData\(->Edit Displays\fR').  Select
any number of display items in the usual way and delete them by
pressing `\fBDelete\fR'.
.PP
As an alternative, you can also type
.sp
.br
  \fBgraph undisplay \fIdisplays...\fR
.sp
.br
at the debugger prompt, where \fIdisplays...\fR is a space-separated
list of display numbers to delete or a single display name.
.PP
If you are using stacked windows, deleting the last display from the
data window also automatically closes the data window.  (You can
change this via `\fBEdit\(->Preferences\(->Data\(->Close data window
when deleting last display\fR'.)
.\"
.\"
.SS "Examining Shared Data Structures"
.\"
By default, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 does not recognize shared data
structures\(em\&that is, a data object referenced by multiple other
data objects.  For instance, if two pointers \fBp1\fR and \fBp2\fR
point at the same data object \fBd\fR, the data displays \fBd\fR,
\fB*p1\fR, and \fB*p2\fR will be separate, although they denote the
same object.
.PP
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 provides a special mode which makes it detect these
situations.  \s-1@DDD@\s+1 recognizes if two or more data displays are
stored at the same physical address, and if this is so, merges all
these \fIaliases\fR into one single data display, the \fIoriginal data
display\fR.  This mode is called \fIAlias Detection\fR; it is enabled
via the `\fBData\(->Detect Aliases\fR'.
.PP
When alias detection is enabled, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 inquires the memory
location (the \fIaddress\fR) of each data display after each program
step.  If two displays have the same address, they are merged into
one.  More specifically, only the one which has least recently changed
remains (the \fIoriginal data display\fR); all other aliases are
\fIsuppressed\fR, i.e. completely hidden.  The edges leading to the
aliases are replaced by edges leading to the original data display.
.PP
An edge created by alias detection is somewhat special: rather than
connecting two displays directly, it goes through an \fIedge hint\fR,
describing an arc connecting the two displays and the edge hint.
.PP
Each edge hint is a placeholder for a suppressed alias; selecting an
edge hint is equivalent to selecting the alias.  This way, you can
easily delete display aliases by simply selecting the edge hint and
clicking on `\fBUndisplay ()\fR'.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-aliases.ps 15.3cm
.PP
To access suppressed display aliases, you can also use the Display
Editor.  Suppressed displays are listed in the Display Editor as
\fIaliases\fR of the original data display.  Via the Display Editor,
you can select, change, and delete suppressed displays.
.PP
.PSPIC @srcdir@/PICS/ddd-edit-displays.ps 15.3cm
.PP
Suppressed displays become visible again as soon as
.br
.IP \(bu 2
alias detection is disabled, 
.br
.IP \(bu 2
their address changes such that they are no more aliases, or
.br
.IP \(bu 2
the original data display is deleted, such that the least recently
changed alias becomes the new original data display.
.PP
Please note the following \fIcaveats\fR with alias detection:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Alias detection requires that the current programming language
provides a means to determine the address of an arbitrary data
object.  Currently, only C and C++ are supported.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Some inferior debuggers (for instance, SunOS \s-1DBX\s+1) produce
incorrect output for address expressions.  Given a pointer \fIp\fR,
you may verify the correct function of your inferior debugger by
comparing the values of \fIp\fR and \fB&\fIp\fR (unless \fIp\fR
actually points to itself).  You can also examine the data display
addresses, as shown in the Display Editor.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Alias detection slows down \s-1@DDD@\s+1 considerably, which is why it
is disabled by default.  You may consider to enable it only at
need\(em\&for instance, while examining some complex data
structure\(em\&and disable it while examining control flow (i.e.,
stepping through your program).  \s-1@DDD@\s+1 will automatically
restore edges and data displays when switching modes.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Moving Displays Around"
.\"
From time to time, you may wish to move displays at another place in
the data window.  You can move a single display by pressing and
holding \fImouse button 1\fR on the display title.  Moving the pointer while
holding the button causes all selected displays to move along with the
pointer.
.PP
If the data window becomes too small to hold all displays, scroll bars
are created.  If your \s-1@DDD@\s+1 is set up to use \fIpanners\fR
instead, a panner is created in the lower right edge.  When the panner
is moved around, the window view follows the position of the panner.
See `\fBCUSTOMIZING @DDD@\fR', below, for details on how to set up
scroll bars or panners.
.PP
For fine-grain movements, selected displays may also be moved using
the arrow keys.  Pressing \fBShift\fR and an arrow key moves displays
by single pixels.  Pressing \fBCtrl\fR and arrow keys moves displays
by grid positions.
.PP
Edge hints can be selected and moved around like other displays.  If
an arc goes through the edge hint, you can change the shape of the arc
by moving the edge hint around.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Aligning Displays"
.\"
You can align all displays on the nearest grid position by selecting
`\fBData\(->Align on Grid\fR'.  This is useful for keeping edges
horizontal or vertical.
.PP
You can enforce alignment by selecting
`\fBEdit\(->Preferences\(->Data\(->Auto-align displays on nearest grid
point\fR'.  If this feature is enabled, displays can be moved on grid
positions only.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Layouting the Display Graph"
.\"
You can layout the entire graph as a tree by selecting
`\fBData\(->Layout Graph\fR'.
.PP
Layouting the graph may introduce \fIedge hints\fR; that is, edges are
no more straight lines, but lead to an edge hint and from there to
their destination.  Edge hints can be moved around like arbitrary
displays.
.PP
To enable a more compact layout, you can set the
`\fBEdit\(->Preferences\(->Data\(->Use compact layout\fR' option.
This realizes an alternate layout algorithm, where successors are
placed next to their parents.  This algorithm is suitable for
homogeneous data structures only.
.PP
You can enforce layout by setting `\fBEdit\(->Preferences\(->Data\(->

By default, when you move the pointer over a button, \s-1@DDD@\s+1
gives a hint on the button's meaning in a small window.  This feature
is known as \fIbutton tips\fR (also known as \fItool tips\fR or

The default is to have images as well as captions, but you can choose
to have only images (saving space) or only captions.
.PP
If you choose to have neither images nor captions, tool bar buttons
are labeled like other buttons, as in \s-1@DDD@\s+1 2.x.  Note that
this implies that in the stacked window configuration, the common
toolbar cannot be displayed; it is replaced by two separate toolbars,
as in \s-1@DDD@\s+1 2.x.

By default, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 uses Motif scroll bars to scroll the data
window.  Many people find this inconvenient, since you can scroll in
the horizontal or vertical direction only.  As an alternative,
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 provides a panner (a kind of two-dimensional scroll bar).
This is much more comfortable, but may be incompatible with your Motif

However, you may encounter some problems:
.IP \(bu 2
In contrast to the well-documented commands of the inferior debugger,
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 does not know what a user-defined command does.  This
may lead to inconsistencies between \s-1@DDD@\s+1 and the inferior
debugger.  For instance, if your the user-defined command `\fBbp\fR'
sets a breakpoint, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 may not display it immediately,
because \s-1@DDD@\s+1 does not know that `\fBbp\fR' changes the
breakpoint state.
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot use \s-1@DDD@\s+1 \fBgraph\fR commands within user-defined
commands.  This is only natural, because user-defined commands are
interpreted by the inferior debugger, which does not know about
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 commands.
.PP
As a solution, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 provides a simple facility called
\fIauto-commands\fR.  If \s-1@DDD@\s+1 receives any output from the
inferior debugger in the form `\fIprefix\fR \fIcommand\fR', it will
interpret \fIcommand\fR as if it had been entered at the debugger
prompt.  \fIprefix\fR is a user-defined string, for example `\fB@ddd@:

Suppose you want to define a command `\fBgd\fR' that serves as
abbreviation for `\fBgraph display\fR'.  All the command \fBgd\fR has
to do is to issue a string
.br
.sp
  \fB@ddd@: graph display \fIargument\fR
.sp
.br
where \fIargument\fR is the argument given to `\fBgd\fR'.  Using

Please note: In your commands, you should choose some other prefix

\s-1GDB\s+1 and \s-1XDB\s+1 also accept the `\fBq\fR' command or an
end-of-file character (usually \fBCtrl+D\fR).  Closing the last

.PP
An interrupt (\fBEsc\fR or \fBInterrupt\fR) does not exit from
\s-1@DDD@\s+1, but rather terminates the action of any debugger
command that is in progress and returns to the debugger command level.
It is safe to type the interrupt character at any time because the
debugger does not allow it to take effect until a time when it is
safe.
.PP
In case an ordinary interrupt does not succeed, you can also use an
abort (\fBCtrl+\\\fR or \fBAbort\fR), which sends a \s-1QUIT\s+1
signal to the inferior debugger.  Use this in emergencies only; the
inferior debugger may be left inconsistent or even exit after a
\s-1QUIT\s+1 signal.
.PP
As a last resort\(em\&if \s-1@DDD@\s+1 hangs, for example\(em\&, you
may also interrupt \s-1@DDD@\s+1 itself using an interrupt signal
(\s-1SIGINT\s+1).  This can be done by typing the interrupt character
(usually \fBCtrl+C\fR) in the shell \s-1@DDD@\s+1 was started from, or
by using the \s-1UNIX\s+1 `\fBkill\fR' command.  An interrupt signal
interrupts any \s-1@DDD@\s+1 action; the inferior debugger is
interrupted as well.  Since this interrupt signal can result in
internal inconsistencies, use this as a last resort in emergencies
only; save your work as soon as possible and restart \s-1@DDD@\s+1.

To have \s-1@DDD@\s+1 run as an inferior debugger in other front-ends,
set up your debugger front-end such that `\fB@ddd@ \-\-tty\fR' is
invoked instead of the inferior debugger.  When \s-1@DDD@\s+1 is
invoked using the `\fB\-\-tty\fR' option, it enables its
\fI\s-1TTY\s+1 interface\fR, taking additional debugger commands from
standard input and forwarding debugger output to standard output, just
as if the inferior debugger had been invoked directly.  All remaining
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 functionality stays unchanged.

In case your debugger front-end uses the \s-1GDB\s+1
`\fB\-fullname\fR' option to have \s-1GDB\s+1 report source code
positions, the `\fB\-\-tty\fR' option is not required.  \s-1@DDD@\s+1

You may also invoke `\fB@ddd@ \-\-tty\fR' directly, entering
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 commands from your \s-1TTY\s+1, or use \s-1@DDD@\s+1 as

that the \s-1TTY\s+1 interface does not support line editing and
command completion and that \s-1@DDD@\s+1 exits as soon as it detects
an \s-1EOF\s+1 condition on its standard input.  Also, do not try to

\fIlesstif hacks\fR can be enabled and disabled at run time.
.PP
Whether the \fIlesstif hacks\fR are included at run-time depends on
the setting of the `\fBlessTifVersion\fR' resource.
`\fBlessTifVersion\fR' indicates the LessTif version against which
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 is linked.  For LessTif version \fIx.y\fR, its value is
\fIx\fR multiplied by 1000 plus \fIy\fR\(em\&for instance, the value

`\fB\-\-lesstif-version\fR \fIversion\fR'.
.PP
The default value of the `\fBlessTifVersion\fR' resource is derived
from the LessTif library \s-1@DDD@\s+1 was compiled against (or
\fB1000\fR when compiled against OSF/Motif).  Hence, you normally

version number of the library using this resource.  (Unfortunately,
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 cannot detect this at run-time.)

Here are a few scenarios to illustrate this scheme:
.IP \(bu 2
Your \s-1@DDD@\s+1 binary was compiled against OSF/Motif, but you use

remote core files.  Also, be sure to specify a remote process id when
debugging a running program.

The remote debugger is started non-interactively.  Some \s-1DBX\s+1
versions have trouble with this.  If you don't get a prompt from the
remote debugger, use the `\fB\-\-rhost\fR' option instead of
`\fB\-\-host\fR'.  This will invoke the remote debugger via an
interactive shell on the remote host, which may lead to better

Note: using `\fB\-\-rhost\fR', \s-1@DDD@\s+1 invokes the inferior
debugger as soon as a shell prompt appears.  The first output on the

your shell prompt on the remote host.

The time to wait (in ms) before taking an action due to having
detected a grabbed pointer.  During this delay, a working dialog pops
up telling the user about imminent execution of the grab action (see
the `\fBgrabAction\fR' resource, above).  If the pointer grab is
released within this delay, the working dialog pops down and no action 
is taken.  This is done to exclude pointer grabs from sources other

If this is `\fBoff\fR', the command tool is created as a
\fItransient window\fR.  Several window managers keep transient
windows automatically on top of their parents, which is appropriate
for the command tool.  However, your window manager may be configured
not to decorate transient windows, which means that you cannot easily
move the command tool around.
.IP \(bu 2
If this is `\fBon\fR', \s-1@DDD@\s+1 realizes the command tool as a

.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.\" ---------------
.\"
.SS "Limitations using GDB"
.\"
Some \s-1GDB\s+1 settings are essential for \s-1@DDD@\s+1 to work correctly.
These settings with their correct values are:
.sp
.br
  \fBset height 0\fR
.br
  \fBset width 0\fR
.br
  \fBset verbose off\fR
.br
  \fBset prompt (gdb) \fR
.br
.sp
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 sets these values automatically when invoking
\s-1GDB\s+1; if these values are changed, there may be some
malfunctions, especially in the data display.
.PP
When debugging at the machine level with \s-1GDB\s+1 4.12 and earlier
as inferior debugger, use a `\fBdisplay /x $pc\fR' command to ensure
the program counter value is updated correctly at each stop.  You may
also enter the command in \fB$HOME/.gdbinit\fR or (better yet) upgrade
to the most recent \s-1GDB\s+1 version.
.PP
.\"
.SS "Limitations using DBX"
.\"
When used for debugging Pascal-like programs, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 does not
infer correct array subscripts and always starts to count with 1.
.PP
With some \s-1DBX\s+1 versions (notably Solaris \s-1DBX\s+1),
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 strips C-style and C++-style comments from the
\s-1DBX\s+1 output in order to interpret it properly.  This also
affects the output of the debugged program when sent to the debugger
console.  Using the separate execution window avoids these problems.
.PP
In some \s-1DBX\s+1 versions (notably \s-1DEC\s+1 \s-1DBX\s+1 and
\s-1AIX\s+1 \s-1DBX\s+1), there is no automatic data display.  As an
alternative, \s-1@DDD@\s+1 uses the \s-1DBX\s+1 `\fBprint\fR' command
to access data values.  This means that variable names are interpreted
according to the current frame; variables outside the current frame
cannot be displayed.
.\"
.SS "Limitations using XDB"
.\"
There is no automatic data display in \s-1XDB\s+1.  As a workaround,
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 uses the `\fBp\fR' command to access data values.  This
means that variable names are interpreted according to the current
frame; variables outside the current frame cannot be displayed.
.\"
.SS "Limitations using JDB"
.\"
.PP
There is no automatic data display in \s-1JDB\s+1.  As a workaround,
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 uses the `\fBdump\fR' command to access data values.
This means that variable names are interpreted according to the
current frame; variables outside the current frame cannot be
displayed.
.PP
The \s-1JDB\s+1 `\fBdump\fR' and `\fBprint\fR' commands do not support
expression evaluation.  Hence, you cannot display arbitrary
expressions.
.PP
Parsing of \s-1JDB\s+1 output is quite CPU-intensive, due to the
recognition of asynchronous prompts (any thread may output anything at
any time, including prompts).  Hence, a program producing much console
output is likely to slow down \s-1@DDD@\s+1 considerably.  In such a
case, have the program run with \fB\-debug\fR in a separate window and
attach \s-1JDB\s+1 to it using the \fB\-passwd\fR option.
.\"
.SS "General Limitations"
.\"
If command output is sent to the debugger console, it is impossible
for \s-1@DDD@\s+1 to distinguish between the output of the debugged
program and the output of the inferior debugger.  This problem can be
avoided by running the program in the separate execution window.
.PP
Output that confuses \s-1@DDD@\s+1 includes:
.IP \(bu 2
Primary debugger prompts (e.g. `\fB(gdb) \fR' or `\fB(dbx) \fR')
.IP \(bu 2
Secondary debugger prompts (e.g. `\fB>\fR')
.IP \(bu 2 
Confirmation prompts (e.g. `\fB(y or n) \fR')
.IP \(bu 2
Prompts for more output (e.g. `\fBPress RETURN to continue\fR')
.IP \(bu 2
Display output (e.g. `\fB$pc = 0x1234\fR')
.PP
If your program outputs any of these strings, you should run it in the
separate execution window.
.PP
If the inferior debugger changes the default \s-1TTY\s+1 settings, for
instance through a `\fBstty\fR' command in its initialization file,
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 will likely become confused.  The same applies to
debugged programs which change the default \s-1TTY\s+1 settings.

.SS "How to Report Bugs"
.\"
Here are some guidelines for bug reports:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
\fIreport all the facts\fR.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known.  It is not very important what happens
if the bug is already known.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug is not known.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Your bug report should be self-contained.  Do not refer to information
sent in previous mails; your previous mail may have been forwarded to
somebody else.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Please report each bug in a separate message.  This makes it easier
for us to track which bugs have been fixed and to forward your bugs
reports to the appropriate maintainer.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Please report bugs in English; this increases the chances of finding
someone who can fix the bug.  Do not assume one particular person will
receive your bug report.
.br
.PP
.\"
.SS "What to Include in a Bug Report"
.\"
To enable us to fix a \s-1@DDD@\s+1 bug, you \fImust\fR include the
following information:
.br
.IP \(bu 2
Your \s-1@DDD@\s+1 configuration.  Invoke \s-1@DDD@\s+1 as

.sp
.br
to get the configuration information.  If this does not work, please
include at least the \s-1@DDD@\s+1 version, the type of machine you
are using, and its operating system name and version number.
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The debugger you are using and its version (e.g., `\fBgdb-4.17\fR' or
`\fBdbx as shipped with Solaris 2.6\fR').
.br
.IP \(bu 2
The compiler you used to compile \s-1@DDD@\s+1 and its version (e.g.,

.SH "HISTORY"
.\" ---------------
.\"
The history of \s-1@DDD@\s+1 is a story of code recycling.  The oldest
parts of \s-1@DDD@\s+1 were written in 1990, when \fIAndreas Zeller\fR
designed \s-1VSL\s+1, a box-based visual structure language for
visualizing data and program structures.  The \s-1VSL\s+1 interpreter
and the \s-1BOX\s+1 library became part of Andreas' Diploma Thesis, a
graphical syntax editor based on the Programming System Generator
\s-1PSG\s+1.
.PP
In 1992, the \s-1VSL\s+1 and \s-1BOX\s+1 libraries were recycled for
the \s-1NORA\s+1 project.  For \s-1NORA\s+1, an experimental
inference-based software development tool set, Andreas wrote a graph
editor (based on \s-1VSL\s+1 and the \s-1BOX\s+1 libraries) and
facilities for inter-process knowledge exchange.  Based on these
tools, \fIDorothea Ltkehaus\fR (now \fIDorothea Krabiell\fR) realized
\s-1@DDD@\s+1 as her Diploma Thesis, 1994.
.PP
The original \s-1@DDD@\s+1 had no source window; this was added by
Dorothea during the winter of 1994\(en1995.  In the first quarter of
1995, finally, Andreas completed \s-1@DDD@\s+1 by adding command and
execution windows, extensions for \s-1DBX\s+1 and remote debugging as
well as configuration support for several architectures.  Since then,
Andreas has further maintained and extended \s-1@DDD@\s+1, based on
the comments and suggestions of several \s-1@DDD@\s+1 users around the
world.  See the comments in the \s-1@DDD@\s+1 source for details.
