# Debug the Debugger
# ------------------
# 
# I appreciate that the April 1997 _Communications_
# covers the issue of debugging
# and hope we programmers can be relieved
# from the pain of debugging
# with the help of advanced tools.
# However, all I'm looking for today
# is a well-debugged debugger.
# I have been working
# with C/C++ debuggers from several Unix vendors
# as well as a Microsoft Windows-based debugger.
# All of them more than occasionally fail
# to perform some very basic function,
# such as setting a break point,
# displaying a data structure,
# evaluating an expression,
# and looking up a symbol.
# Some of them simply crash too often.
#
# My observation is that the debugger
# is often buggier
# than the program being debugged.
# One debugging difficulty Eisenstadt points out
# is the inability of the debugging tool.
# This is certainly true.
# I should emphasize that the difficulty
# is often a debugger-reliability problem
# rather than a capability problem.

# Default arguments
set args -I @srcdir@/../vsllib @srcdir@/ddd.vsl

# That's all!
echo Enter `run' to start VSL.\n
end

document vsl

end


## Debug DDD w/ Perl

define perl
    ddd
    set args --perl --trace @srcdir@/perltest.pl
end
document perl

end


# Print DDD string types
define string
    p $.rep->s[0]@$.rep->len
end
document string
    Print value of last viewed DDD string
end

define pstring
    p $arg0.rep->s[0]@$arg0.rep->len
end
document string
    Print value of DDD string ARG
end

# Just let the user know we're here.
# echo Enter `ddd' to debug DDD.\n
