(1) The very first line is a comment line containing the name and version:
	#FIG 2.1

    The character # at the first column of a line indicates that the line
    is a comment line which will be ignored.

(2) The first non-comment line consists of two numbers :

	int	fig_resolution		(pixels/inch)
	int	coordinate_system	(1 : origin is at the lower left corner
					 2 : Upper left)

    Fig_resolution is the resolution fig is using for the current file.
    It must always be 80 for compatibility with this version of Fig.
    Pixels are assumed to be square.

#define FIGHEAD "#FIG 2.1\n" \

                "#Creator: Box::print() by Christian Lindig\n"


/*
(3) The rest of the file contains various objects.  An object can be one
    of six classes (or types).

	  i)	Arc.
	 ii)	Ellipse which is a generalization of circle.
	iii)	Polyline which includes polygon and box.
	 iv)	Spline which includes closed/open control/interpolated spline.
	  v)	Text.
	 vi)	Compound object which is composed of one or more objects.

    In the following elaboration on object formats, every value of fig
    output are separated by blank characters or new line ('\n').  The
    value of the not-used parameters will be -1.

    Some fields are described as "enumeration type" or "bit vector"; the 
    values which these fields can take are defined in the header file object.h.
    The pen, arrow_type, and arrow_style fields are described as unused.
    These values may be defined in some future version of Fig.

    The color field is defined as follows:

	-1 = Default
	 0 = Black
	 1 = Blue
	 2 = Green
	 3 = Cyan
	 4 = Red
	 5 = Magenta
	 6 = Yellow
	 7 = White
	 values from 8 to 2^30-1 = reserved for future use

    The depth field is defined as follows:

	 0 ... 999 where larger value means object is deeper than (under)
		   objects with smaller depth

    The area fill field is defined as follows:
	
	 0 = not filled
	 1 = white
	...  values from 2 to 20 are shades of grey, from lighter to darker
	21 = black

    The line_style field is defined as follows:

	-1 = Default
	 0 = Solid
	 1 = Dashed
	 2 = Dotted

    The style_val field is defined as the length, in pixels, of the
    on/off dashes for dashed lines, and the distance between the dots, in
    pixels, for dotted lines.
