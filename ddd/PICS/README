This directory contains the pictures contained in the DDD manual.  A
formatted copy of the DDD manual is already part of the DDD source
distribution.  Hence, this directory is needed only if you want to
create a local copy of the DDD manual after some change; it is
contained in a separate distribution.

To re-create the DDD Manual, enter the `ddd' directory (one level
above the `PICS' directory) and enter `make postscript'.

The following suffixes are used:

	.xpm	- XPM file
	.fig	- FIG file (from the XFIG graphic editor)
	.eps	- encapsulated PostScript file.
