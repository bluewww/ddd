This directory contains the pictures contained in the PostScript copy
of the DDD manual.  These pictures are needed only if you want to
re-create the PostScript DDD manual, so they are not part of the
standard DDD source distribution.

To re-create the DDD Manual, enter the `ddd' directory (one level
above the `PICS' directory) and enter `make postscript'.

The following suffixes are used:

	.xpm	- XPM file
	.fig	- FIG file (from the XFIG graphic editor)
	.eps	- encapsulated PostScript file.
