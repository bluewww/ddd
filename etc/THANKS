**********

(Most of these statements are actually taken from bug reports, so your
 mileage may vary :-)

jcrupi@mystech.com (John Crupi):

    I would just like to tell that I am extremely impressed with ddd.
    I am an dedicated gdb user and have been looking for a gui front
    end for quite a while.

Kent.williams@cadsi.com (Kent Williams):

    Thanks -- it looks like it will be a cool program once I figure
    out how to get it to run at all.

baird@asc.on.ca (Warren Baird):

    Thank you for creating such an excellent debugger.  I've used it
    briefly on one of our non-SGI machines, and it looks like it will be
    very useful.  I look forward to getting it ported to the SGI.

darryl@chc.bpss.eds.com (Darryl House):

    Thank you for providing a much-needed product.

Herve.Poirier@xerox.fr (Herve Poirier):

    DDD seems a very good debugger.

hannu@cctap.carel.fi (Hannu Mallat):

    Looks like debugging could be fun with it!

taob@gate.sinica.edu.tw (Brian Tao):

    Clicked around in the source window, followed functions
    around, created a few data displays, etc. (very neat!).

glenn@mathcs.emory.edu (Glenn Barry):

    thx for a very cool debugger!

ric@coronacorp.com (Ric Steinberger):

    DDD is great!

ross@wanda.mecalc.co.za (Ross Linder):

    Great work, its really nice to see some OSF/Motif Compliant
    products.

dmike@CS.HUJI.AC.IL (Michael Dorfman):

    Thanks for the best debugger!

vickery@babbage.cs.qc.edu (Christopher Vickery):

    This package is really great.  The Free Software Foundation and
    the Unix community at large should award you a medal for what ddd
    is going to do for the gdb community.  Thank You!

smcarey@mailbox.syr.edu (Shawn M. Carey):

    First, let me say thanks for making what has to be the nicest
    debugger for X I have seen!  ddd is really a class act, and I'll
    be sending you a postcard soon.

weber@gabor.ece.cmu.edu (Dave Weber):

    This is a really nice product with a nice, clean look and feel. I
    have used xxgdb and I prefer ddd.  I do miss the set temporary
    break of xxgdb.  I look forward to working with ddd in the future.
