To solve this problem, I need to see the interaction between DDD and
the inferior debugger.  Please run DDD with the `--trace' option and
let me know what happens.

This looks like a problem of the inferior debugger (i.e. GDB).
Remember that DDD is only a front-end.  See your debugger
documentation for details on reporting bugs and getting assistance.
(For GDB, send a bug report to `bug-gdb@prep.ai.mit.edu'.)

This will be in the next DDD release.  In fact, it already has been
implemented.  If you really need this feature, you can try out the
current DDD snapshot from one of these sites:

I have made some changes in DDD that should fix your problem.
Unfortunately, I cannot test them as I don't have an appropriate
configuration.  Please check out tomorrow's DDD snapshot from one of
these sites:

    ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/packages/ddd/current/

Please let me know if my changes have helped to solve your problem,
and which problems still persist.

The DDD home page (http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/) contains
several pointers to DDD sources and binaries.  In particular, see our
main FTP server and its mirrors at:

    ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/
    ftp://ftp.th-darmstadt.de/pub/programming/tools/ddd/
    ftp://ftp.gre.ac.uk/pub/tools/debuggers/ddd/
    ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/packages/ddd/
    ftp://richb-pc.acc.qc.edu/pub/ddd/

There is a patch which might fix this problem.  See the list at:

    ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/patches/
    ftp://ftp.th-darmstadt.de/pub/programming/tools/ddd/patches/

    ftp://richb-pc.acc.qc.edu/pub/ddd/patches/

When using GCC 2.8.0, `ddd/VSLRead.o' must be generated without `-O'
flag.  Type `cd ddd; rm VSLRead.o; make CXXOPT=-DNDEBUG VSLRead.o' and
re-build DDD.


Thanks for your support,
