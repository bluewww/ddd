To solve this problem, I need to see the interaction between DDD and
the inferior debugger.  Please run DDD with the `--trace' option and
let me know what happens.

This will be in DDD 2.1.  In fact, it already has been implemented.
If you really need this feature, you can try out the current DDD
snapshot from one of these sites:

I have made some changes in DDD that should fix your problem.
Unfortunately, I cannot test them as I don't have an appropriate
configuration.  Tomorrow, you may wish to check out my working DDD
copy from one of these sites:

Please let me know if my changes have helped to solve your problem,
and which problems still persist.

The DDD home page (http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/) contains
several pointers to DDD sources and binaries.  In particular, see our
main FTP server and its mirrors at:
