Title:          ddd
Version:        1.2
Entered-date:   May 24, 1995
Description:    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a novel graphical user
                interface to GDB, the popular UNIX debugger.  Besides
                ``usual'' features such as viewing source texts and
                breakpoints, DDD provides a *graphical data display*,
                where data structures are displayed as graphs.  Complex
                data structures can be explored incrementally and
                interactively. Other features include: hypertext source
                navigation and lookup; GDB command-line interface with
                full editing, history, and completion capabilities;
                breakpoint, backtrace, and history editors; optional
                program execution in terminal emulator window; debugging
                on remote host; on-line manual; interactive help on the
                OSF/Motif user interface.
Keywords:       ddd, GUI, debugger, visualization
