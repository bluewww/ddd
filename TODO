# The DDD projects.

This is a list of frequently suggested DDD features, which should be
realized in some future DDD release.  If you want to realize one or
more of these projects, please ask us (ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether
there are already people working on that project.  Similar, if you
have a project idea, be sure to send it to us such that we may realize
it (or include it in this list :-)

Projects marked with an `*' represent work in progress.
Volunteers for these and other projects are welcome!

001. Have DDD ported to a free widget set -- Athena or lwlib, for
     example.  DDD could then be included in the GNU distribution.

003. Support full annotation mode (`gdb --annotate=2').  This would
     make prompt recognition easier and allow full trace of the current
     GDB status.  Disadvantage: won't work with earlier GDBs and requires
     a major redesign.

004. Have interactive help -- a wrapper to the GDB `help' command.

006. With GDB 4.14 and later, define `graph display' command such that
     a special code is issued which causes DDD to show the display.
     Thus, one could use `graph display' in own definitions.
     See also 067, below.

008. Have buttons arranged such that they do not disappear when the
     window is narrowed.

009. Recognize shared data structures (that is, two displays
     referencing the same object).  This could be achieved by
     comparing display addresses.  See also the mail of
     markusd@cs.tu-berlin.de (Markus Dahm).

011. Have local source files without path indication located via the
     GDB directories setting.  Maybe through the `info source'
     and `show directories' commands?

017. Have the graph editor scroll automatically when the pointer drags
     something out of the visible part of the window.

021. In the manual index, use special fonts for bold keywords.
     [Requires Motif 2.0 and CMText.]

025. Have auto-unfolding for recursive data structures.  Dereferencing
     a pointer P * would automatically select all P * members in the
     referenced structure.

026. Have optional abstraction levels, hiding implementation details.
     Every data type would be assigned an individual VSL function
     determining its representation.

031. Have a three-dimensional data display (using red/green glasses) :-)

033. Call for bug report if `make' fails.  But how?

034. Call for bug report if a fatal X error occurs.

037. Group dereference.  If multiple pointers are selected,
     dereference them all.

044. Disable pointer grabs from the debugged application as soon as
     the Debugger prompt reappears.  But how?

049. albrecht@igpm.rwth-aachen.de (Harald Albrecht):
     The dialog windows (especially the backtrace dialog) should not
     exceed a specific size (at least, they should not be larger than
     the screen :-).  Also, the DDD dialogs should be iconified on
     their own, without always laying on top of the main windows.

050. Include algorithm animation; for instance, in a way similar to
     LENS (see ftp.cc.gatech.edu:pub/people/stasko).  Suggested by
     bruce@liverpool.ac.uk (Bruce Stephens).

054. Adapt DDD to DBX as found on DEC Alpha.  Ruediger Berlich
     <berlich@pc66.mppmu.mpg.de> has a description of the DBX format.

056. Have current arguments (`info args') and local variables (`info
     locals') be displayed.

058. leo@dmbsdi.datamar.com.ar says: I'm using ddd v1.4 with dbx on SGI
     with IRIX 5.3.  1) When I debug inside the operating system I
     receive all the time a window telling that I don't have source.

060. When using a dynamic version of libstdc++, configure fails
     to add its location to the -R flag.

063. Have a (generic) panel for GDB options.  Inquire setting and
     documentation strings via `show'.

064. Have scrolling parameters user-configurable.

066. Upgrade rx library to rx-1.0.  Should be less buggy (and more portable).

067. Andy Gill (andy@dcs.gla.ac.uk) wants more options to
     `graph display': ``for example,

        graph display[x=100,y=100,rotate] foo

     where foo is an array. This means put the object at location
     (x=100,y=100), and rotate the array.  Using this in conjunction
     with with the TODO 006 means that when restarting a program that
     you are debugging you could have a script of what vars you are
     looking at, and where you want them to go on your
     canvas. Furthermore, there could be an option on the graph window
     that let you dump such scripts automatically generated from the
     current layout on the canvas.''  See also 076.

068. Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de>: Have `ptype' (in DBX:
     `whatis') inserted into the source popup menu, such that users
     can inquire variable types.

069. Yves Arrouye <Yves.Arrouye@marin.fdn.fr> states:

     3. Add a way to cast a display. What I mean is that when I debug some
        code with a `generic' C function which takes a void* and a tag that
        indicates the kind of stuff the void* is really, I'd like to be able
        to cast the displayed void* (maybe by editing the text
        field---dangerous---or simply by having a 'Cast' item in the popup
        menu). The fastest way to do that actually is to select `Dependent
        display', type the cast there, and then delete the original display
        (because what we want is in the casted display).

     4. Let one colorize the displays. By using regexps on types or
        names of the fields, it would already be extremely useful (or
        with a match on the typed expression, having a list of regexps
        to match, the first match giving color, so that given blue for
        ` pr_.*' and red for `^int .*' one would see `int pr_var' in
        blue but all other int variables in red). Does VSL support
        colors ?

070. Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> suggests an option to set
     debuggee arguments when invoking DDD.  A simple way of
     implementing that would be: if more than one argument is given,
     or if the 1st argument is neither a core file nor a process ID,
     use the remaining arguments as debugee execution arguments.

071. Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> suggests code annotations
     (i.e. comments and graphics that are associated with certain
     variable/function names in the code).

073. While the debuggee is running, show some image sequence in the DDD
     window (similar to Netscape :-)

074. Have a `ddd-announce' mailing list, where only DDD announcements
     are posted.  (Hmm.  Might be time for a USENET newsgroup
     `comp.debuggers.ddd.announce' :-)

075. Andre Cormeau <ac@enci.ucalgary.ca> says:

     Apparently ddd does not fully support fortran. A problem is in
     variable names, with capital letters and underscores (not strict
     f77).  I need to change the variable names to small caps and add
     underscores to the end of the names, which is a bit annoying
     after a while.  Is there a filter to do this out there?
     [This is a problem in the underlying debugger.  -AZ]

076. Henrik Seidel <henrik@satchmo.physik.tu-berlin.de> says:

     I am missing a feature which would be very useful (but, maybe,
     difficult to implement). Maybe it is already there and I just
     don't see it: I would love to be able to save the layout and the
     variables of the graphic display, so that I can use the same
     layout if I continue debugging the program tomorrow. More
     important, I do not like it so much that I have to re-establish
     the graphic display each time I recompile. Currently, after
     recompiling all variables displayed in the previous version of
     the program are now undefined, probably because addresses have
     changed. Is there a trick to make them be defined again? If not,
     it might be a good idea to save the displayed variables not by
     their address but, more source-code oriented, by their scope and
     name. That way, it shouldn't be too difficult to save the
     displayed variables and find the corresponding variables even
     after recompiling.  See also 067.

077. Have a way to show all display detail.  Maybe by selecting `show' on a
     title?

078. Have mirror sites for the DDD WWW page.  Maybe via the DDD FTP
     mirrors?

080. Include the FAQ in the DDD manual.  Better yet, include all
     top-level documentation in the DDD manual (including news,
     problems, etc.) and generate it from this single source.

081. Pre-scan the X event queue for ^C events.  When ^C is found,
     discard all other user input, and process ^C.

082. For remote debugging, use an on-line `rlogin' connection,
     invoking the inferior debugger from the remote shell.

083. Include graphplace (or other graph layout) support.

084. Support DBXes that don't know the `display' command, such as
     IBM and DEC dbx.  Use `print' instead whenever the prompt comes.

085. Include xDuel support.  See `http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~frangy/'
     for details.

086. Move the status line to the bottom and give one-liner
     explanations about items pointed at.

087. Have configurable buttons that take their arguments from the
     mouse buffer.

088. (Insert your project idea here)
