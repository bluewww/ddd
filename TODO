# The DDD projects.

This is a list of frequently suggested DDD features, which should be
realized in some future DDD release.  If you want to realize one or
more of these projects, please ask us (ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether
there are already people working on that project.  Similar, if you
have a project idea, be sure to send it to us such that we may realize
it (or include it in this list :-)

Projects marked with an `*' represent work in progress.
Volunteers for these and other projects are welcome!

001. Have DDD ported to a free widget set -- Athena or lwlib, for
     example.  DDD could then be included in the GNU distribution.
     [Discarded; wait for LessTif people to finish.  -AZ]

003. Support full annotation mode (`gdb --annotate=2').  This would
     make prompt recognition easier and allow full trace of the current
     GDB status.  Disadvantage: won't work with earlier GDBs and requires
     a major redesign.
     [Discarded; won't work with DBX and XDB.  -AZ]

004. Have interactive help -- a wrapper to the GDB `help' command.

006. With GDB 4.14 and later, define `graph display' command such that
     a special code is issued which causes DDD to show the display.
     Thus, one could use `graph display' in own definitions.
     See also 067, below.

008. Have buttons arranged such that they do not disappear when the
     window is narrowed.

009. Recognize shared data structures (that is, two displays
     referencing the same object).  This could be achieved by
     comparing display addresses.  See also the mails of
     markusd@cs.tu-berlin.de (Markus Dahm) and finster@ave.ac.agit.de
     (Harald Finster).  Possible renderings include:
     a) Merge two objects into one (maybe temporary?)
     b) Move one object on top of the other
     c) Draw a special `identity edge' between the two objects.

017. Have the graph editor scroll automatically when the pointer drags
     something out of the visible part of the window.

021. In the manual index, use special fonts for bold keywords.
     [Requires Motif 2.0 and CMText.]

025. Have auto-unfolding for recursive data structures.  Dereferencing
     a pointer P * would automatically select all P * members in the
     referenced structure.

026. Have optional abstraction levels, hiding implementation details.
     Every data type would be assigned an individual VSL function
     determining its representation.

031. Have a three-dimensional data display (using red/green glasses) :-)

033. Call for bug report if `make' fails.  But how?

     J.H.M. Dassen <jdassen@wi.leidenuniv.nl> suggests using two
     makefiles: Makefile.real (which does all the hard work, and
     touches a file "buildcompleted" [1]; if 1. is implemented,
     "buildcompleted" means that the build is indeed completed) and
     Makefile (a wrapper that executes Makefile.real, and that
     displays the error message if "buildcompleted" doesn't exist
     after executing Makefile.real).  Alternatively, you can merge
     these into one makefile.

     [1] Of course, as long as DDD produces only one executable, you could
     ddd/ddd instead.

034. Call for bug report if a fatal X error occurs.

037. Group dereference.  If multiple pointers are selected,
     dereference them all.

044. Disable pointer grabs from the debugged application as soon as
     the debugger prompt reappears.  But how?

     Vadim Rogozin  <dima@mercury.co.il> suggests to call from GDB:

	call XUngrabPointer(_XHeadOfDisplayList,0)
        call XFlush(_XHeadOfDisplayList)

     He checked it for Solaris and it does work.

049. albrecht@igpm.rwth-aachen.de (Harald Albrecht):
     The dialog windows (especially the backtrace dialog) should not
     exceed a specific size (at least, they should not be larger than
     the screen :-).  Also, the DDD dialogs should be iconified on
     their own, without always laying on top of the main windows.

050. Include algorithm animation; for instance, in a way similar to
     LENS (see ftp.cc.gatech.edu:pub/people/stasko).  Suggested by
     bruce@liverpool.ac.uk (Bruce Stephens).

056. Have current arguments (`info args') and local variables (`info
     locals') be displayed.

060. When using a dynamic version of libstdc++, configure fails
     to add its location to the -R flag.

067. Andy Gill (andy@dcs.gla.ac.uk) wants more options to
     `graph display': ``for example,

        graph display[x=100,y=100,rotate] foo

     where foo is an array. This means put the object at location
     (x=100,y=100), and rotate the array.  Using this in conjunction
     with with the TODO 006 means that when restarting a program that
     you are debugging you could have a script of what vars you are
     looking at, and where you want them to go on your
     canvas. Furthermore, there could be an option on the graph window
     that let you dump such scripts automatically generated from the
     current layout on the canvas.''
     [See also 076 -AZ]

069. Yves Arrouye <Yves.Arrouye@marin.fdn.fr> states:

     3. Add a way to cast a display. What I mean is that when I debug some
        code with a `generic' C function which takes a void* and a tag that
        indicates the kind of stuff the void* is really, I'd like to be able
        to cast the displayed void* (maybe by editing the text
        field---dangerous---or simply by having a 'Cast' item in the popup
        menu). The fastest way to do that actually is to select `Dependent
        display', type the cast there, and then delete the original display
        (because what we want is in the casted display).

     4. Let one colorize the displays. By using regexps on types or
        names of the fields, it would already be extremely useful (or
        with a match on the typed expression, having a list of regexps
        to match, the first match giving color, so that given blue for
        ` pr_.*' and red for `^int .*' one would see `int pr_var' in
        blue but all other int variables in red). Does VSL support
        colors ?

070. Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> suggests an option to set
     debuggee arguments when invoking DDD.  A simple way of
     implementing that would be: if more than one argument is given,
     or if the 1st argument is neither a core file nor a process ID,
     use the remaining arguments as debugee execution arguments.  [In
     DDD, this is difficult to implement while conserving remote mode.
     This should be an extension to GDB, not to DDD.  - AZ]

071. Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> suggests code annotations
     (i.e. comments and graphics that are associated with certain
     variable/function names in the code).

073. While the debuggee is running, show some image sequence in the DDD
     window (similar to Netscape :-)

074. Have a `ddd-announce' mailing list, where only DDD announcements
     are posted.  (Hmm.  Might be time for a USENET newsgroup
     `comp.debuggers.ddd.announce' :-)

075. Andre Cormeau <ac@enci.ucalgary.ca> says:

     Apparently ddd does not fully support fortran. A problem is in
     variable names, with capital letters and underscores (not strict
     f77).  I need to change the variable names to small caps and add
     underscores to the end of the names, which is a bit annoying
     after a while.  Is there a filter to do this out there?
     [This is a problem in the underlying debugger.  -AZ]

076. Henrik Seidel <henrik@satchmo.physik.tu-berlin.de> says:

     I am missing a feature which would be very useful (but, maybe,
     difficult to implement). Maybe it is already there and I just
     don't see it: I would love to be able to save the layout and the
     variables of the graphic display, so that I can use the same
     layout if I continue debugging the program tomorrow. More
     important, I do not like it so much that I have to re-establish
     the graphic display each time I recompile. Currently, after
     recompiling all variables displayed in the previous version of
     the program are now undefined, probably because addresses have
     changed. Is there a trick to make them be defined again? If not,
     it might be a good idea to save the displayed variables not by
     their address but, more source-code oriented, by their scope and
     name. That way, it shouldn't be too difficult to save the
     displayed variables and find the corresponding variables even
     after recompiling.
     [See also 067 -AZ]

078. Have mirror sites for the DDD WWW page.  Maybe via the DDD FTP
     mirrors?

080* Include the FAQ in the DDD manual.  Better yet, include all
     top-level documentation in the DDD manual (including news,
     problems, etc.) and generate it from this single source.

083. Include graphplace (or other graph layout) support.

085. Include xDuel support.  See `http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~frangy/'
     for details.

086. Move the status line to the bottom and give one-liner
     explanations about items pointed at.

088. Some suggestions by Oyvind Yrke <oyvind@stavanger.geoquest.slb.com>:

     o When setting a breakpoint, it should be possible to select from
       a list matching a regexp.  This feature would be particularly
       useful when working with c++ code with overloading, templates
       and member functions.

     o In data display, it would be extremely useful to select which
       fields of a (big) struct should be displayed.  In the current
       version, you have to display the whole struct, or display
       individual elements in separate boxes which wastes space.

     o Ability to group variables as selections that can be
       enabled/disabled separately.  For big applications, the data
       display quickly gets overcrowded.  Disabling data display of
       these variables will not save much screen space.  So if I can
       select some of the variable boxes in the data display, and save
       them for later retrieval would be use very useful.

     o Display of variables are disabled when stepping into a new
       function, i.e. variables in functions "above" the current frame
       are not displayed.  Although I can circumvent this problem by
       typing the full path (e.g.  graph display
       /some/deeply/nested/directory/file.c:a, this is quite
       inconvenient.  The function/file prefix should probably be
       omitted (at least as an option), since otherwise the data
       display would be messed up with very long variable names as in
       SunOS dbxtool/debugger.  Displaying an element of an array in
       dbxtool as you iterate through the array looks like

         '/a_very/long/path/'funcname'data['/a_very/long/path'funcname'i] = 17

       Some sort of user customization is probably needed here to
       avoid lengthy names (e.g. by specifying how many directories
       should be displayed).  An alternative is to have a status line
       in the data window too specifying the full path of the data box
       where the cursor is pointing.
        
     o Since you supply ddd binaries, why not supply gdb binaries as
       well?

094. Have a VSL 'string()' function that extracts the string from a
     box.  With an additional VSL 'matches()' function that matches
     regexps, one may display different types in different
     colors, fonts, etc.

095. Have a colored DDD icon (requires Xpm).

099. Add a history mechanism to the `()' fields (cursor up / cursor
     down).

102. Have a WWW tutorial for DDD.  Any volunteers?

103* In the `registers' window, optionally display floating-point
     registers as well  (`info all-registers').

104* Use DDD to do debugging where gdb and the program under test
     would be remote, but the source would be local.  As an
     alternative, try the local file if the remote source cannot be
     found.  (A `Source info' window would be helpful here, stating
     which source was loaded and how)

105* Thread support. Siddharth Ram <srram@qualcomm.com> and James
     Njeru <njeru@oec.com> state: It should be easy to add some sort
     of menu choice (based on the dbx, xdb, gdb in use) to switch
     threads.  Another useful feature is allowing one to choose to
     follow child forked processes or not.

106* If `-lXm' is not found, point to `--with-motif-libraries' and
     `--with-motif-includes' options.  Do the same with `-lXaw'.

107. Have toolbar tips, as in NetScape 3.0 or WinWord.

108. David M. Karr <dkarr@nmo.gtegsc.com> suggests:
     In the SparcWorks debugger, if I use the "list" command at the
     internal dbx prompt, it lists the object or lines I specify in the
     source window.  I believe that "ddd" should work this way.  Is there a
     way to get this behavior, or is it simply not designed for this?

109. N. Dan Zou <zou@hooked.net> wrote: there's no way to toggle the 
     selection state of a box without disturbing the other selected
     boxes.  [Place this on Button2 or Shift+Button1?  -AZ]

110. N. Dan Zou <zou@hooked.net> suggests a way to display the class
     structure of an existing program graphically.  [Use the `ptype'
     output to display types graphically; dereference type names as
     required.  -AZ]

111. Include `Settings' support for DBX.

112* Have a user-settable tab width in the source window.

113. In DBX, use `setenv EDITOR echo' and `edit' to determine the
     full path of the current source file.  Be sure to reset EDITOR to
     its original value afterwards, such that the debuggee won't be
     confused.

114. Have a link to GDB info---for instance, using
     `xterm -e info --file gdb Index COMMAND'

115. In DBX, use `where N' instead of GDB `frame N'.

116. Paul Courbis <plc@lexem.fr> says: upon dereferencing a pointer, 
     it would be nice to have a menu to say: display hex data for 255 bytes.

117. (Insert your project idea here)
