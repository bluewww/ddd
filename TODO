# The DDD projects.

This is a list of frequently suggested DDD features, which should be
realized in some future DDD release.  If you want to realize one or
more of these projects, please ask us (ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether
there are already people working on that project.  Similar, if you
have a project idea, be sure to send it to us such that we may realize
it (or include it in this list :-)

Projects marked with an `*' are scheduled for the next DDD release.
Volunteers for these and other projects are welcome!

017 Have the graph editor scroll automatically when the pointer drags
    something out of the visible part of the window.

021 In the manual index, use special fonts for bold keywords.
    [Requires Motif 2.0 and CMText.]

025 Have auto-unfolding for recursive data structures.  Dereferencing
    a pointer P * would automatically select all P * members in the
    referenced structure.

026 Have optional abstraction levels, hiding implementation details.
    Every data type would be assigned an individual VSL function
    determining its representation.

031 Have a three-dimensional data display (using red/green glasses) :-)

033 Call for bug report if `make' fails.  But how?

    J.H.M. Dassen <jdassen@wi.leidenuniv.nl> suggests using two
    makefiles: Makefile.real (which does all the hard work, and
    touches a file "buildcompleted" [1]; if 1. is implemented,
    "buildcompleted" means that the build is indeed completed) and
    Makefile (a wrapper that executes Makefile.real, and that
    displays the error message if "buildcompleted" doesn't exist
    after executing Makefile.real).  Alternatively, you can merge
    these into one makefile.

    [1] Of course, as long as DDD produces only one executable, you could
    ddd/ddd instead.

037 Group dereference.  If multiple pointers are selected,
    dereference them all.

050 Include algorithm animation; for instance, in a way similar to
    LENS (see ftp.cc.gatech.edu:pub/people/stasko).  Suggested by
    bruce@liverpool.ac.uk (Bruce Stephens).

060 When using a dynamic version of libstdc++, configure fails
    to add its location to the -R flag.

069 Yves Arrouye <Yves.Arrouye@marin.fdn.fr> states:
    Let one colorize the displays. By using regexps on types or names
    of the fields, it would already be extremely useful (or with a
    match on the typed expression, having a list of regexps to match,
    the first match giving color, so that given blue for ` pr_.*' and
    red for `^int .*' one would see `int pr_var' in blue but all
    other int variables in red).

070 Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> suggests an option to set
    debuggee arguments when invoking DDD.  A simple way of
    implementing that would be: if more than one argument is given,
    or if the 1st argument is neither a core file nor a process ID,
    use the remaining arguments as debugee execution arguments.  [In
    DDD, this is difficult to implement while conserving remote mode.
    This should be an extension to GDB, not to DDD.  - AZ]

071 Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> suggests code annotations
    (i.e. comments and graphics that are associated with certain
    variable/function names in the code).

078 Have mirror sites for the DDD WWW page.  Maybe via the DDD FTP
    mirrors?

080 Convert the DDD manual to texinfo, as in ICE, resulting in an
    HTML manual.  See also 102.

083 Include graphplace (or other graph layout) support.

085 Include xDuel support.  See `http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~frangy/'
    for details.

094 Have a VSL 'string()' function that extracts the string from a
    box.  With an additional VSL 'matches()' function that matches
    regexps, one may display different types in different
    colors, fonts, etc.

102 Have a WWW tutorial for DDD.  See also 080.

110 N. Dan Zou <zou@hooked.net> suggests a way to display the class
    structure of an existing program graphically.  [Should be
    implemented as follows: use the `ptype' output to display types
    graphically; dereference type names as required.  -AZ]

115 Have links from help texts to appropriate sections of the DDD manual.

117 Paul Courbis <plc@lexem.fr> says: upon dereferencing a pointer, 
    it would be nice to have a menu to say: display hex data for 255 bytes.

119 Try whether the `-fno-implement-inlines' option in DDD reduces
    executable size.

120 Check whether `dbxenv output_short_file_name off' helps in
    debugging with DBX.

122 Have a window that shows DDD/GDB communication, with the ability
    to modify commands before they are processed.

126 `shorten' may need some improvements (count `(' and `)'
    occurrences, etc.)

129 Detect self-modifying code.

131 Include the Athena Panner widget in the DDD distribution, such
    that Athena/Motif conflicts are removed.

143 Have a list of regexes that suppress or hide displays when matched.
    [Could this done by pressing `delete' on members?  And should other
     displayed items be affected, too?  -AZ]

152 When dereferencing, make new displays inherit the show/hide,
    enable/disable state of their ancestors.  How about selection state?

153 Include assembler support for Sun DBX (they have a `dis' command).

154 Allow users to specify geometries for dialog windows.

155 Allow users to specify start-up commands that open specific
    windows (for instance, open-backtrace(X, Y) would open the
    backtrace window at X, Y; open-backtrace() would open it in some
    default position).  See also #154, above.

160 Support DEC `decladebug'.  Jens Albrecht
    <Jens.Albrecht@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> has a trace.

161 Daniel Lyddy <sprocket27@earthlink.net> suggests: Would it be
    feasible to allow the user to select multiple commands in the
    "Command History" window?  One could hold down the "Shift" key
    while selecting a contiguous block of commands and the "Control"
    key to select non-contiguous commands, a la Windoze File Manager.

164 Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> suggests:
    - Selection: Double click to select words - moving the mouse then
      expands on the basis of words
    - Attach base as attributes to variables, fields of
      structs/unions; load/save
    - recognize URLs in source window; follow on click (call external
      browser)

166 When the inferior debugger crashes, offer to restart it.  This
    may be done by replaying all previously issued commands (except
    the last one, of course).  Commands with external side-effects
    (such as running or making the program as well as shell commands)
    should be ignored.

171 Use double-buffering to display the graph.  Even less flickering.

175 Theodore Papadopoulo <papadop@sophia.inria.fr> suggests a smaller 
    font for large matrices.

176 Theodore Papadopoulo <papadop@sophia.inria.fr> wants the
    capability of "freezing" some displayed values. By this, I mean
    that I want to have some displayed data to remain displayed
    (presumably as a copy?) as it is at the moment the user asks for
    this freezing.  This would give to the user a simple way of
    comparing the state of the program in different (but related)
    functions, in different calls of a same function or in different
    runs of the program with different (but again related)
    parameters. And as far as I can see it, this is purely some
    interface stuff so does not need for any support from the
    debugger.

177 Create menu children in the background, using a work procedure.

179 Add `libgdb' as an alternate communication method.

183 Have a way to re-dereference until no more changes occur.

193 Have a way to unfold trees and graphs.  For instance, `Display
    *()' applied to a struct could dereference all contained pointers
    (unless already dereferenced).

197 Implement a fast lookup table for assembler locations.  Current
    linear search may be too slow for large assembly listings.

199 Use X11R6 XtSignalNotify for Xt-safe signal handling.

201 Install hotkeys on the command tool, using Harald Albrecht's
    package (in `http://www.igpm.rwth-aachen.de/~albrecht/mnem.html')

206 `manage_and_raise' should deiconify dialogs.

215 Raoul Beauduin <beauduin@ori.u-tokyo.ac.jp> suggests to change
    the green arrow in the source window into a green bar. Makes it
    easier to follow the line.
    [You can turn off glyphs and get a black bar.  -AZ]

216 Raoul Beauduin <beauduin@ori.u-tokyo.ac.jp> wants to be able to
    view the content of an array graphically.  Useful when you know
    what kind of array you are expecting (symmetric, diagonal ...)

217 Winson Quock <quock@pepper.com> (see the quote in `ddd/exit.C')
    says: Very often, I found myself spending quite a lot of time
    arranging each "display box".  It will be cool if we can also
    have a normal text list display for variable values.

219 Annotated arrows. Christoph Koegl <koegl@informatik.uni-kl.de>
    suggests that the data display window should be able to annotate
    arrows with the name of the pointer variables whose value they
    represent. This would come in handy if one (as I do at the
    moment) displays heavily cross-pointered data structures.

221 Have a DDD USENET news group, such as `comp.debuggers[.ddd]',
    instead of a mailing list.  [This should be done when there are
    more than 1000 subscribers, or when the number of messages/day is
    greater than 50.]

232 Have an `infinite' assembler window that extends in both
    directions as needed.

233 Have a `bookmarks' menu like the `Highlight' menu in tkman.

241 Include a mail reader.  See also `feeping creaturism'.

242 Make programs dump core by forking and killing them.

246 Martin Fick <fick@fgm.com> suggests that breakpoints should be
    toggled by double-clicking on the beginning of a line of code.

249 `Rotate' should be enabled as soon as there is exactly one child
    that can be rotated.

252 Print via the X Printer extension (-lXp).

254 If an XEmacs is running, use its frame for displaying the text.

257 Show whether a conditional jump (breakpoint?) will be taken or not.

266 Include TAGS support.

273 JORGE HERNANDO <hernando@cnea.edu.ar> wants
    1)  when an array is marked for display, how about a popup where one
    writes the indexes ranges?, e.g. 5-8,* in order to show 
    array(i,j), 5<=i<=8, the whole range of j. Also, with multidimensional
    arrays is easy to be confused about which value we are looking at. Would
    it be possible to show (together with the array value) the indexes 
    values (in another font, size, color, etc)?

277 Allow in-place editing.  There is already a simple `sourceEditing'
    resource, but we'd have to do a lot more to realize decent editing
    capabilities.

287 Have the DDD windows be resized in font increments.

288 Have @ifjdb...@else...@endif constructs in help texts.

289 Enable drop actions.  Dropping an action on the text causes the
    action to perform on the object (or vice versa?)

291 Rich Homolka <rich@stg.com> suggests: When displaying a class
    variable, to be able to toggle between showing only member var's
    defined in that class, or all member variables, including those
    inherited from superclasses.

293 Styles.  Have arrays, etc. be displayed in various visual styles
    such as bar graphs.  This can be easily established using VSL
    functions.  See also 273 and 292.

294 Have a way to expand `VALUE <Nx>' manually.

304 If the source window size has changed (via panes?), recenter the
    command tool.

305 Have all icons parsed from one big XPM file (use a subimage for
    each icon), such that the icon creation time is minimized.

308 Here's a list of GDB concepts that are not yet covered by the DDD GUI:
    * Tracepoints: trace, collect, ...  Is there any doc for that?
    * Overlays: overlay...  Is there any doc for that?
    * Symbol files: symbol-file, add-shared-symbol-file, sharedlibrary.
    * Exception breakpoints: catch.
    * Conditions: if, while.
    * Remote debugging: remote, tfind.
    * Return from frame: return.
    * Shell command: shell.
    * File command options: `-readnow' and `-mapped'

313 Rubber_Buccaneer@Galactic.Headquarters.org thinks that the window
    containing the short cut buttons,i.e. step, next, etc.  should
    always be displayed on top of the main window: `If the main window
    is lowered the short cut box is lowered too, but when the main
    window is raised the short cut box remains lowered. It was only
    through accidentally clicking on the border of the tear-off help
    menu that I discovered this, as the tear-off help window and the
    short cuts box are clearly related.'

316 Bill Bumgarner <bbum@codefab.com> suggests Objective-C
    improvements for use with Foundation from Apple:

    (1) For data of type objc_object * (a pointer to an object), could
        ddd figure out what type of object the datum is pointing to
        and display its class?

    (2) Under Foundation, every object responds to the method
        -description and produces a description of itself-- this can
        range from the value of an NSNumber to the contents of an
        NSArray (and can be long).  It would be tremendously useful
        for ddd to take advantage of this.

    (3) gdb with objective-c has a print-object or po command.  It
        would be great if that appeared on the right-click menu when
        clicking on a variable.

318 To manipulate bitwise structures, Fritjof Flechsig
    <flechsig@itp.uni-hannover.de> suggests a pop-up with some
    check-boxes where each box is one bit.

321 Allow `()' expansion in auto-commands.

322*Add support for the Perl debugger.

325 Allow `snapshots' of the currently displayed data.  Just create
    `frozen' copies of displays that simply display the original data
    (graph display `a = 16`) and are no longer updated.  See also 176.

326 Mihai Budiu <mihaib@gs41.sp.cs.cmu.edu> reports:
    It would be nice if you had a short-cut to display 'this' when
    debugging C++; I found no easy way.
    [graph display `print *this` would help.  -AZ]

329*Have a Display Editor shortcut from the data popup menu.

334 When looking at a C++ identifier X, try `this->X' if `X' is not
    found.  Better yet, try `CLASS::X' if we're in a CLASS member.

339 Finish `Plot History' option:
    - Document it all
    - Add documentation in status line
    - Adapt plot title
    - Also document the help on plot window.

340 Have `Display Array Slice', a friendly interface to the `@' operator.

342 Add a menu bar for the execution window (via swallowing)

345 Have automatic unfolding of data structures using `Layout by
    Example' - that is, lay out the first few elements and have this
    operation repeated until a fix point is reached.  
    See also 025, 183, and 193.

346 If a new display obscures an existing display, use spring-embedded
    layout to resolve conflicts.

348 Allow debugger interaction while the program is running.  Simply
    interrupt the debuggee, do debugger action, and resume execution.
    (This will only work after a `run' or `cont'.)

349 Access Java `.jar' class archives.

350 Harri Pasanen <harri@trema.com> suggests:
    - Allow to pass arguments to defined commands.  More specifically,
      I mean having a command specification where the (): argument
      would be used as $arg0 for the defined command.
    - Command buttons are not restored when opening a session.
    - Incremental search for the source window is also something I miss.

351 Oliver Eichler <oliver.eichler@regensburg.netsurf.de> suggests
    that `Displays' clusters should have two or more columns in order
    to fit the visible part of the display.

352 (Insert new project ideas here)
