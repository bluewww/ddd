# The DDD projects.

This is a list of frequently suggested DDD features, which should be
realized in some future DDD release.  If you want to realize one or
more of these projects, please ask us (ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether
there are already people working on that project.  Similar, if you
have a project idea, be sure to send it to us such that we may realize
it (or include it in this list :-)

Projects marked with an `*' are scheduled for the next DDD release.
Volunteers for these and other projects are welcome!

008 Have buttons arranged such that they do not disappear when the
    window is narrowed.

017 Have the graph editor scroll automatically when the pointer drags
    something out of the visible part of the window.

021 In the manual index, use special fonts for bold keywords.
    [Requires Motif 2.0 and CMText.]

025 Have auto-unfolding for recursive data structures.  Dereferencing
    a pointer P * would automatically select all P * members in the
    referenced structure.

026 Have optional abstraction levels, hiding implementation details.
    Every data type would be assigned an individual VSL function
    determining its representation.

031 Have a three-dimensional data display (using red/green glasses) :-)

033 Call for bug report if `make' fails.  But how?

    J.H.M. Dassen <jdassen@wi.leidenuniv.nl> suggests using two
    makefiles: Makefile.real (which does all the hard work, and
    touches a file "buildcompleted" [1]; if 1. is implemented,
    "buildcompleted" means that the build is indeed completed) and
    Makefile (a wrapper that executes Makefile.real, and that
    displays the error message if "buildcompleted" doesn't exist
    after executing Makefile.real).  Alternatively, you can merge
    these into one makefile.

    [1] Of course, as long as DDD produces only one executable, you could
    ddd/ddd instead.

034 Call for bug report if a fatal X error occurs.

037 Group dereference.  If multiple pointers are selected,
     dereference them all.

049 albrecht@igpm.rwth-aachen.de (Harald Albrecht):
    The dialog windows (especially the backtrace dialog) should not
    exceed a specific size (at least, they should not be larger than
    the screen :-).  Also, the DDD dialogs should be iconified on
    their own, without always laying on top of the main windows.

050 Include algorithm animation; for instance, in a way similar to
    LENS (see ftp.cc.gatech.edu:pub/people/stasko).  Suggested by
    bruce@liverpool.ac.uk (Bruce Stephens).

060 When using a dynamic version of libstdc++, configure fails
    to add its location to the -R flag.

069 Yves Arrouye <Yves.Arrouye@marin.fdn.fr> states:
    Let one colorize the displays. By using regexps on types or names
    of the fields, it would already be extremely useful (or with a
    match on the typed expression, having a list of regexps to match,
    the first match giving color, so that given blue for ` pr_.*' and
    red for `^int .*' one would see `int pr_var' in blue but all
    other int variables in red).

070 Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> suggests an option to set
    debuggee arguments when invoking DDD.  A simple way of
    implementing that would be: if more than one argument is given,
    or if the 1st argument is neither a core file nor a process ID,
    use the remaining arguments as debugee execution arguments.  [In
    DDD, this is difficult to implement while conserving remote mode.
    This should be an extension to GDB, not to DDD.  - AZ]

071 Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> suggests code annotations
    (i.e. comments and graphics that are associated with certain
    variable/function names in the code).

076 Henrik Seidel <henrik@satchmo.physik.tu-berlin.de> says:

    I am missing a feature which would be very useful (but, maybe,
    difficult to implement). Maybe it is already there and I just
    don't see it: I would love to be able to save the layout and the
    variables of the graphic display, so that I can use the same
    layout if I continue debugging the program tomorrow. More
    important, I do not like it so much that I have to re-establish
    the graphic display each time I recompile. Currently, after
    recompiling all variables displayed in the previous version of the
    program are now undefined, probably because addresses have
    changed. Is there a trick to make them be defined again? If not,
    it might be a good idea to save the displayed variables not by
    their address but, more source-code oriented, by their scope and
    name. That way, it shouldn't be too difficult to save the
    displayed variables and find the corresponding variables even
    after recompiling.

078 Have mirror sites for the DDD WWW page.  Maybe via the DDD FTP
    mirrors?

080 Convert the DDD manual to texinfo, as in ICE, resulting in an
    HTML manual.  See also 102.

083 Include graphplace (or other graph layout) support.

085 Include xDuel support.  See `http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~frangy/'
    for details.

088*Some suggestions by Oyvind Yrke <oyvind@stavanger.geoquest.slb.com>:

    o When setting a breakpoint, it should be possible to select from
      a list matching a regexp.  This feature would be particularly
      useful when working with c++ code with overloading, templates
      and member functions.

    o In data display, it would be extremely useful to select which
      fields of a (big) struct should be displayed.  In the current
      version, you have to display the whole struct, or display
      individual elements in separate boxes which wastes space.

    o Ability to group variables as selections that can be
      enabled/disabled separately.  For big applications, the data
      display quickly gets overcrowded.  Disabling data display of
      these variables will not save much screen space.  So if I can
      select some of the variable boxes in the data display, and save
      them for later retrieval would be use very useful.
      [Use Cut/Copy/Paste -AZ]

    o Display of variables are disabled when stepping into a new
      function, i.e. variables in functions "above" the current frame
      are not displayed.  Although I can circumvent this problem by
      typing the full path (e.g.  graph display
      /some/deeply/nested/directory/file.c:a, this is quite
      inconvenient.  The function/file prefix should probably be
      omitted (at least as an option), since otherwise the data
      display would be messed up with very long variable names as in
      SunOS dbxtool/debugger.  Displaying an element of an array in
      dbxtool as you iterate through the array looks like

         '/a_very/long/path/'funcname'data['/a_very/long/path'funcname'i] = 17

      Some sort of user customization is probably needed here to
      avoid lengthy names (e.g. by specifying how many directories
      should be displayed).  An alternative is to have a status line
      in the data window too specifying the full path of the data box
      where the cursor is pointing.
        
094 Have a VSL 'string()' function that extracts the string from a
    box.  With an additional VSL 'matches()' function that matches
    regexps, one may display different types in different
    colors, fonts, etc.

099 Add a history mechanism to the `()' fields (cursor up / cursor down).

102 Have a WWW tutorial for DDD.  See also 080.

108 David M. Karr <dkarr@nmo.gtegsc.com> suggests:
    In the SparcWorks debugger, if I use the "list" command at the
    internal dbx prompt, it lists the object or lines I specify in the
    source window.  I believe that "ddd" should work this way.  Is there a
    way to get this behavior, or is it simply not designed for this?

110 N. Dan Zou <zou@hooked.net> suggests a way to display the class
    structure of an existing program graphically.  [Should be
    implemented as follows: use the `ptype' output to display types
    graphically; dereference type names as required.  -AZ]

115 Have a link from help texts to appropriate sections of the DDD manual.

117 Paul Courbis <plc@lexem.fr> says: upon dereferencing a pointer, 
    it would be nice to have a menu to say: display hex data for 255 bytes.

119 Try whether the `-fno-implement-inlines' option in DDD reduces
    executable size.

120 Check whether `dbxenv output_short_file_name off' helps in
    debugging with DBX.

122 Have a window that shows DDD/GDB communication, with the ability
    to modify commands before they are processed.

126 `shorten' may need some improvements (count `(' and `)'
    occurrences, etc.)

128 Have a way to completely remove selected struct members from the
    view.  Suggested by marjeta@mccabe.com (Marjeta Cedilnik).
    [Could this done by pressing `delete' on them?  And should other
     displayed items be affected, too?  -AZ]

129 Detect self-modifying code.

131 Include the Athena Panner widget in the DDD distribution, such
    that Athena/Motif conflicts are removed.

143 Have a list of regexes that suppress or hide displays when
    matched.  See also #128 and #088.

152 When dereferencing, make new displays inherit the show/hide,
    enable/disable state of their ancestors.  How about selection state?

153 Include assembler support for Sun DBX (they have a `dis' command).

154 Allow users to specify geometries for dialog windows.

155 Allow users to specify start-up commands that open specific
    windows (for instance, open-backtrace(X, Y) would open the
    backtrace window at X, Y; open-backtrace() would open it in some
    default position).  See also #154, above.

160 Support DEC `decladebug'.  Jens Albrecht
    <Jens.Albrecht@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> has a trace.

161 Daniel Lyddy <sprocket27@earthlink.net> suggests: Would it be
    feasible to allow the user to select multiple commands in the
    "Command History" window?  One could hold down the "Shift" key
    while selecting a contiguous block of commands and the "Control"
    key to select non-contiguous commands, a la Windoze File Manager.

164 Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> suggests:
    - Recognize 'complete' variables; example "ptr->struct.field": if
      one points inside this string always show the value of
      ptr->struct.field.
    [ A selection followed by a click on `Print ()' will do. - AZ]
    - Selection: Double click to select words - moving the mouse then
      expands on the basis of words
    - possibility to select the base (dec, hex, oct ...) for
      displayed values; Attach this as attributes to variables,
      fields of structs/unions; load/save
    - detecting when graph display takes too long (n seconds
      configurable) if it takes too long switch in mode where updates
      are only done on request
    - Dump inspector hex[+/]ascii/octal dump of length n starting at
      address a. Possibility to 'group' data : selecting bytes in
      dump with mouse; declare them to be a particular data type
      (2/4/8 Byte integer/unsigned, float, real, pointer; select
      numeric base and byte order); load and store such definitions;
      apply such definition starting at a specified point.
      Possibility to 'graph display', modify and write back values
      from the dump.
    - recognize URLs in source window; follow on click (call external
      browser)

166 When the inferior debugger crashes, offer to restart it.  This
    may be done by replaying all previously issued commands (except
    the last one, of course).  Commands with external side-effects
    (such as running or making the program as well as shell commands)
    should be ignored.

168 Rename `Lookup' to `List' and recognize the `list' command.  See
    also #108.

170 In the `File' menu, keep a history of most recently opened files
    (executables? sources? sessions?)

171 Use double-buffering to display the graph.  Even less flickering.

175 Theodore Papadopoulo <papadop@sophia.inria.fr> suggests a smaller 
    font for large matrices.

176 Theodore Papadopoulo <papadop@sophia.inria.fr> wants the
    capability of "freezing" some displayed values. By this, I mean
    that I want to have some displayed data to remain displayed
    (presumably as a copy?) as it is at the moment the user asks for
    this freezing.  This would give to the user a simple way of
    comparing the state of the program in different (but related)
    functions, in different calls of a same function or in different
    runs of the program with different (but again related)
    parameters. And as far as I can see it, this is purely some
    interface stuff so does not need for any support from the
    debugger.

177 Create menu children in the background, using a work procedure.

179 Add `libgdb' as an alternate communication method.

181 If the DDD WWW page server is down, try a mirror site.

183 Have a way to re-dereference until no more changes occur.

187 Have a `commands' menu listing up all debugger commands.  Could
     be organized according to `help' classes.

193 Have a way to unfold trees and graphs.  For instance, `Display
    *()' applied to a struct could dereference all contained pointers
    (unless already dereferenced).

196 Realize GUI support for the GDB `handle' commands 
    (`Signal handling' or so).

197 Implement a fast lookup table for assembler locations.  Current
    linear search may be too slow for large assembly listings.

199 Use X11R6 XtSignalNotify for Xt-safe signal handling.

201 Install hotkeys on the command tool, using Harald Albrecht's
    hotkey package (in
    `http://www.igpm.rwth-aachen.de/~albrecht/mnem.html')

206 `manage_and_raise' should deiconify dialogs.

215 Raoul Beauduin <beauduin@ori.u-tokyo.ac.jp> suggests to change
    the green arrow in the source window into a green bar. Makes it
    easier to follow the line.
    [You can turn off glyphs and get a black bar.  -AZ]

216 Raoul Beauduin <beauduin@ori.u-tokyo.ac.jp> wants to be able to
    view the content of an array graphically.  Useful when you know
    what kind of array you are expecting (symmetric, diagonal ...)

217 Winson Quock <quock@pepper.com> (see the quote in ddd/exit.C)
    says: Very often, I found myself spending quite a lot of time
    arranging each "display box".  It will be cool if we can also
    have a normal text list display for variable values.

219 Annotated arrows. Christoph Koegl <koegl@informatik.uni-kl.de>
    suggests that the data display window should be able to annotate
    arrows with the name of the pointer variables whose value they
    represent. This would come in handy if one (as I do at the
    moment) displays heavily cross-pointered data structures.

221 Have a DDD USENET news group, such as `comp.debuggers[.ddd]',
    instead of a mailing list.  [This should be done when there are
    more than 1000 subscribers, or when the number of messages/day is
    greater than 50.]

229 Is it not possible to prevent ddd to put up ANY windows until you
    say you want one. ddd insists on putting up a source window even
    if I run it from within xemacs, I've manually hided it with the
    window manager, but still...  [Try `-iconic'  -AZ]

232 Have an `infinite' assembler window that extends in both
    directions as needed.

233 Have a `bookmarks' menu like the `Highlight' menu in tkman.

235 L. Peter Deutsch <ghost@aladdin.com> suggests:

    * There are 4 different styles of command selection in the GUI:
      menu bar (at the top), individual command buttons (2 rows),
      floating 2-D button panel (Run, Interrupt, etc.), and pop-up
      menus.  I think the GUI would look better with fewer styles,
      but I'm not sure how I would recommend doing it.  I think it
      would be especially nice to remove the two bars of buttons
      across the window, which currently take up nearly 1" of
      vertical space that I would prefer to have available for other
      things.  My first thought is to turn those two bars into
      floating panels like the Run / Interrupt panel.

   * I would like to be able to select the font for each window,
     specifically so that I can use a smaller font to get more data
     visible in the data window.  ddd already has a nice
     "preferences" facility: this would be an obvious place to add
     this capability.

240 If a new display A' is created from some display A, copy the
    selection state in A to A'.  This way, you can easily dereference
    a series of `next' pointers just by pressing `Display *' again and 
    again.

241 Include a mail reader.  See also `feeping creaturism'.

242 Make programs dump core by forking and killing them.

246 Martin Fick <fick@fgm.com> suggests that breakpoints should be
    toggled by double-clicking on the beginning of a line of code.

247 Hans Zuidam <hans@brandinnovators.com> wants to make scrolling a
    source window a little slower when dragging breakpoints.

249 `Rotate' should be enabled as soon as there is exactly one child
    that can be rotated.

250*Combine Breakpoint `Ignore Count' and `Condition' in a `Breakpoint
    Properties' panel.  Breakpoint commands to be executed may also be
    added.

252 Print via the X Printer extension (-lXp).

254 If an XEmacs is running, use its frame for displaying the text.

256*Add a `hint of the day' that might be shown at start-up.  Ask on
    ddd-announce for possible hints.

257 Show whether a conditional jump (breakpoint?) will be taken or
    not.

265*Make all toolbar actions accessible via alternate ways:
    - Add `Rotate' to the Display Editor.
    - Add `Lookup', `Find', and `Print' to the Source Menu.

266 Include TAGS support.

268 (Insert new project ideas here)
