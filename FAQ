DDD Frequently Asked Questions					-*- text -*-
******************************

1.  Can I dereference a multi-length array graphically via the mouse?

    The problem is that GDB does not know the actual length of the
    array; you have to supply it by hand (i.e. using the keyboard).
    You can use the DDD ``display successive array elements`` or the
    GDB ``artificial array'' mechanism.  If you have a pointer, say:
    
        int *pi;
    
    pointing to an array of 10 ints, you can see the integers by
    entering
    
        graph display pi[0..9]
    
    at the `(gdb)' prompt (or entering `pi[0..9]` in the `Dependent
    Display' dialog).
    
    As an alternative, you can use the GDB ``artificial array'' mechanism
    by entering
    
        graph display pi[0]@10
    
    This will create an array starting with pi showing the first 10
    elements.


2.  Does DDD sit on top of GDB, or is it integrated with gdb source?

    DDD sits on top of a separate GDB process.  Use `ddd --trace' to
    see the interaction.


3.  If it sits on top, how can GDB upgrades be incorporated?

    By getting and installing the new GDB.  No changes to DDD are
    necessary, unless the GDB developers introduce incompatible
    changes.


4.  Does DDD work with DBX on other systems than Sun?

    DDD has been reported to run with Sun DBX as shipped with SunOS
    4.x and Solaris 2.  Unfortunately, DBX is quite different across
    machines since every vendor icorporated his own extensions.  As
    long as some basics stay the same, DDD may work more or less with
    other DBX versions as well.  If not, extending the DDD code to
    support other DBX versions is not too difficult.  Use `ddd
    --trace' to see the interaction.


5.  I don't like the 'break point' symbol.  Can I change it?

    Yes - by altering the code :-).  I may make it user-defineable
    some day, but the choice is limited to text characters unless you
    supply your own text font.


6.  I compiled DDD on my machine and it fails.  I got the executable
    from an FTP site and it runs.  What is the difference? Is there
    some compilation setup I need to do, or is the executable patched?

    It is a frequently observed effect that our executables work while
    the executables of DDD users fail.  This is simply due to the fact
    that we test them throroughly.  The usual test a new DDD
    distribution has to pass is to configure, compile, and run
    out-of-the-box on half a dozen machines and configurations.
    
    We do not really know why our executables work while others fail,
    although the source code is identical.  A simple explanation may
    be that the compilation environment (C compiler, C++ compiler,
    libraries...) have slight differences (aka bugs) from site to
    site.  We have set up DDD such that it works on our site - for
    instance, some DDD parts work around compiler bugs detected on a
    specific machine.  Users compiling DDD on their local machine will
    encounter other problems, but will not know how to fix them.  That
    is, while the DDD code stays the same, the executables may vary a
    lot.


7.  I have heard that there is a magic command built into DDD.
    Is this true, and what is this magic command for?

    You'll have to find out this one for yourself.  Use the source,
    Luke.


8.  Is there an Athena Widgets port of DDD?

    No.  If you want DDD running with a free widget set, you should
    support the LessTif team, who are developing a free
    Motif-compliant widget set.  Check out their WWW page at
    
    http://www.cs.uidaho.edu:8000/hungry/microshaft/lesstif.html


9.  Why does my DDD call `xmkmf' when being started?

    To run properly, OSF/Motif requires a file called `XKeysymDB' in
    the X project root.  Since we distribute DDD binaries, the X
    project root compiled into the X libraries (and thus hard-coded in
    the DDD binary) may not be valid on the actual machine.  DDD tries
    to repair this situation by calling `xmkmf' and thus determining
    the X project root.  Usually, this is not required if DDD runs on
    the machine it was compiled on.  You may run `ddd
    --check-configuration' to find out why DDD finds it necessary to
    determine the X project root.  The code for this hack can be found
    in `xconfig.C'.


10. How can I change DDD resources (especially colors)?

    Copy the appropriate resource lines from the `Ddd' file contained
    in the DDD distribution (type `./configure -v; cd ddd; make Ddd'
    to create it from scratch) in your `~/.dddinit' file.  For
    instance, to make the background less bright, use:

	Ddd*XmText.background:             light grey
	Ddd*XmTextField.background:        light grey
	Ddd*GraphEdit.background:          light grey
	Ddd*XmList.background:             light grey
