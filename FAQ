DDD Frequently Asked Questions					-*- text -*-
******************************

1. Is there a way to edit the source in the source window?

No.  First, although the Motif Text widget supports editing sources,
this would be difficult to realize because of the line numbers,
breakpoint symbols etc.  which would have to be updated after each
change.  Second, it would be difficult to maintain consistency between
the debugger line information and the edited source; for instance,
lookup() and break() commands would still refer to the last compiled
source.  Third, there are virtually no limits on what a source editor
should be able to; we don't think it is useful to implement yet
another Emacs.


2. Can I dereference a multi-length array graphically via the mouse?

The problem is that GDB does not know the actual length of the array;
you have to supply it by hand (i.e. using the keyboard).
You can use the DDD ``display successive array elements`` or the GDB
``artificial array'' mechanism.  If you have a pointer, say:

int *pi;

pointing to an array of 10 ints, you can see the integers by entering

graph display pi[0..9]

at the `(gdb)' prompt (or entering `pi[0..9]` in the `Dependent
Display' dialog).

As an alternative, you can use the GDB ``artificial array'' mechanism
by entering

graph display *pi@10

This will create an array starting with pi showing the first 10 elements.


3. Does DDD sit on top of GDB, or is it integrated with gdb source?

DDD sits on top of a separate GDB process.  Use `ddd --trace' to see
the interaction.


4. If it sits on top, how can GDB upgrades be incorporated?

By getting and installing the new GDB.  No changes to DDD are
necessary, unless the GDB developers introduce incompatible changes.


5. Does DDD work with DBX on other systems than Sun?

DDD has been reported to run with Sun DBX as shipped with SunOS 4.x
and Solaris 2.  Unfortunately, DBX is quite different across machines
since every vendor icorporated his own extensions.  As long as some
basics stay the same, DDD may work more or less with other DBX
versions as well.  If not, extending the DDD code to support other DBX
versions is not too difficult.  Use `ddd --trace' to see the
interaction.


6. I don't like the 'break point' symbol.  Can I change it?

Yes - by altering the code :-).  I may make it user-defineable some
day, but the choice is limited to text characters unless you supply
your own text font.


7. When I hit a break point, can the break line
   be brought to the center of the source window?

Again, by altering the code - I guess I'll realize that in a future
DDD release.


8. I compiled DDD on my machine and it fails.  I got the executable
   from an FTP site and it runs.  What is the difference? Is there
   some compilation setup I need to do, or is the executable patched?

It is a frequently observed effect that our executables work while the
executables of DDD users fail.  This is simply due to the fact that we
test them throroughly.  The usual test a new DDD distribution has to
pass is to configure, compile, and run out-of-the-box on half a dozen
machines and configurations.

We do not really know why our executables work while others fail,
although the source code is identical.  A simple explanation may be
that the compilation environment (C compiler, C++ compiler,
libraries...) have slight differences (aka bugs) from site to site.
We have set up DDD such that it works on our site - for instance, some
DDD parts work around compiler bugs detected on a specific machine.
Users compiling DDD on their local machine will encounter other
problems, but will not know how to fix them.  That is, while the DDD
code stays the same, the executables may vary a lot.


9. I have heard that there is a magic command built into DDD.
   Is this true, and what is this magic command for?

You'll have to find out this one for yourself.  Use the source, Luke.


10. Is there an Athena Widgets port of DDD?

No.
