Instructions for beta testers					-*- text -*-
*****************************

If this package name contains the string `beta', then this is a beta
distribution, and the following terms apply.

This DDD source distribution has been tested on a large variety of
configurations, excluding yours.  If you encounter any repeatable
problem while building or running DDD, please let us know - especially
if the problem is not listed in the `BUGS' or `PROBLEM' file.  (We
will either fix it or document it.)  Please send bug reports to
`ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de'.

Besides the usual bug reports, we would like to hear your comments and
suggestions on the new DDD features (alias detection, status displays,
thread support, button and value tips).  Please send suggestions to
`ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de'.

If all goes well, the `final' DDD 2.1 release will be made available
in April, 1997.  Until then, have fun with this beta distribution.
