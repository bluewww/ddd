DDD Icons						-*- text -*-
*********

This directory contains `official' DDD icons in XPM format, for use
with an X window manager that can display XPM icons (such as FVWM or
derived).

Install these files in one of the pixmap directories searched by your
X window manager (FVWM: look for the `IconPath' resource in your
~/.fvwmrc).  For details on window manager setup, see the WWW site
`http://www.plig.org/xwinman/'.
