# This is a list of tips for DDD.  Every time DDD is started, one tip
# will be selected from this file and will be displayed in the `Tip of
# the day' dialog.
#
# - Lines starting with `#' and `!' are comments.
#   `!` comments will appear in the resource file, `#' comments will not.
# - Blank lines or comments separate two tips (they are not ignored).
#   Multiple blank lines are treated as one.  If you want to have a
#   blank line in a tip, put a space or tab in it.
# - Text will appear in the dialog as it is in this file.  This is
#   done on purpose in order to have more freedom in the layout of the
#   tips than with automatic word-wrapping, but this also means that
#   you have to avoid excessively long lines in this file.
# - This file is processed by M4 and may contain typesetting macros.
#   See `ddd/macros.m4' for details.
# - Tips should be concise: 3 lines or less.

# Include Macro definitions

! First tips.

Welcome to DDD!
You can get help on all items by pointing at them and pressing F1.
And don't worry, there is the LBL(Help) menu with much more information...

Buttons with a small triangle in the upper right corner are special:
pressing and holding BUTTON(1) on them will pop up a menu 
with additional options.

There are three ways to show the value of a variable:
ITEM You can view its value, simply by pointing at it;
ITEM You can print its value in the debugger console, using LBL(Print ());
ITEM You can display it graphically, using LBL(Display ()).

A quick way to manipulate variables, breakpoints, and displays
is to press BUTTON(3) on them.

The difference between LBL(OK) and LBL(Apply) is that 
LBL(OK) pops down the dialog, while LBL(Apply) does not.

To quickly dereference pointers in the data display,
double-click on them.


! Intermediate tips.

When using GDB, all text fields have command and argument completion
with KEY(Tab), just like the shell.  In a file selection box, type part of a filename,
hit KEY(Tab), and voila!  It's completed.

To display a variable-length array in GDB, enter 
KBD(graph display VAR(ptr)\1330\135@ VAR(n)) at the GDB prompt.
This displays VAR(n) elements of a C or C++ array VAR(ptr).

To scroll the data display, most users find a EMPH(panner)
much more convenient than two scrollbars.
Check out LBL(Edit) | LBL(Preferences) | LBL(Startup) | LBL(Data Scrolling).

To limit the number of array elements in a data display, set
LBL(Edit) | LBL(GDB Settings) | LBL(Limit on array elements to print).

If DDD cannot find a source, don't use LBL(File) | LBL(Open Source).
Instead, set the @GDB@ source path via LBL(Edit) | LBL(@GDB@ Settings).

To see the EMPH(actual) type of a C++ object in GDB, set
LBL(Edit) | LBL(GDB Settings) | LBL(Set printing of object's derived type).

To display VAR(data) in hexadecimal format, display it and choose
LBL(Convert to Hex) from the LBL(Display ()) menu, 
or enter KBD(graph display /x VAR(data)) at the GDB prompt.

To send a signal to the debuggee, use the GDB SAMP(signal) command.
For instance, to continue execution with an interrupt signal, use
KBD(signal SIGINT) or KBD(signal 2) at the GDB prompt.

You can repeat the last command by hitting KEY_RETURN.
Use KEY(Ctrl+R) and KEY(Ctrl+S) to search the command history.

You can save space by disabling toolbar captions.
See LBL(Edit) | LBL(Preferences) | LBL(Startup) | LBL(Toolbar Appearance).

In GCC, SAMP(-Wall) does not enable all warnings.  See the GCC
documentation for other warnings you might consider useful.

To get a global idea of what a process or program does or is doing,
use a system call tracer, like SAMP(strace), SAMP(truss), or SAMP(trace).
BY(J.H.M. Dassen, jdassen@ wi.leidenuniv.nl)

To have GDB start your program automatically upon startup,
put the following lines in your FILE(.gdbinit) file:
CODE(break main)      - or some other initial function
CODE(run       )      - possibly giving arguments here


! Advanced tips.

To get rid of these tips of the day, unset
LBL(Edit) | LBL(Preferences) | LBL(Startup) | LBL(Show Tip of the Day).

You can have each of DDD, @GDB@ and the debugged program run on
different machines.  See the DDD KBD(--rhost) option for details.

To save and restore data displays, cut, copy and paste them via the
LBL(Edit) menu.  Together with CODE(xclipboard), you can manage
arbitrary collections of data displays.

To stop this debugging session and resume later, use 
LBL(File) | LBL(Save Session).

To debug a child process, put a call to SAMP(sleep) in the child right
after the SAMP(fork) call.  Run the program and attach to the child process
using LBL(File) | LBL(Attach to Process).

If you suspect memory corruption caused by problematic pointers, try
linking with Electric Fence SAMP(efence) or the SAMP(dbmalloc) library
(URL(http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/zorn/public_html/MallocDebug.html)).
BY(J.H.M. Dassen, jdassen@ wi.leidenuniv.nl)

Prevention is better than cure.  Document your assumptions using CODE(<assert.h>) 
or GNU NANA (URL(http://wattle.cs.ntu.edu.au/homepages/pjm/nana-home/)).

To execute frequently used commands with one mouse click,
define your own DDD buttons via LBL(Commands) | LBL(Edit Buttons).

The debugger isn't a substitute for good thinking.  But, in some
cases, thinking isn't a substitute for a good debugger either.  The
most effective combination is good thinking and a good debugger.
QUOTE(Steve McConnell, Code Complete)

When debugging an X application, there is always a risk of
interrupting it while the mouse pointer is grabbed (frozen).  To
prevent this, set LBL(Edit) | LBL(Preferences) | LBL(General) |
LBL(Ungrab mouse pointer when interrupting modal X application).

You can easily resume a saved DDD VAR(session)
by invoking DDD as KBD([ddd] =VAR(session)).

When you're totally stuck, try to find a helpful ear.  In my experience,
nothing helps you more in debugging than to try to explain your problem
(what your code should do, and what it actually does) to someone else.
