# This is a list of tips for DDD.  Every time DDD is started, one tip
# will be selected from this file and will be displayed in the `Tip of
# the day' dialog.
#
# - Lines starting with `#' are comments.
# - Blank lines or comments separate two tips (they are not ignored).
#   Multiple blank lines are treated as one.  If you want to have a
#   blank line in a tip, put a space or tab in it.
# - Text will appear in the dialog as it is in this file.  This is
#   done on purpose in order to have more freedom in the layout of the
#   tips than with automatic word-wrapping, but this also means that
#   you have to avoid excessively long lines in this file.
# - This file is processed by M4 and may contain typesetting macros.
#   See `ddd/macros.m4' for details.
# - Tips should be concise: 3 lines or less.

# First tips.

Welcome to DDD!
You can get help on all items by pointing at them and pressing F1.
And don't worry, there is the LBL(Help) menu with much more information...

Buttons with a small riangle in the upper right corner are special:
pressing and holding BUTTON(3) on them will show up a menu with
additional options.

There are three ways to show the value of a variable:
ITEM You can view its value, simply by pointing at it;
ITEM You can print its value in the debugger console, using LBL(Print ());
ITEM You can display it graphically, using LBL(Display()).

You can press BUTTON(3) on variables, breakpoints, and displays
to manipulate them directly.

To quickly dereference pointers in the data display,
double-click on them.


# Intermediate tips.

When using GDB, all text fields have command and argument completion
with KEY(Tab), just like the shell.  In a file selection box, type
part of a filename, hit KEY(Tab), and voila!  It's completed.

Here's how to display a variable-length array.  To display the first
VAR(n) elements of a C or C++ array VAR(ptr), enter KBD(graph display
VAR(ptr)[0]@VAR(n)) at the GDB prompt.

To scroll the data display, most users find a panner much more
convenient than two scrollbars.  If it works for you, check out
LBL(Edit) | LBL(Preferences) | LBL(Startup) | LBL(Data is scrolled).

To limit the number of array elements in a data display, select
LBL(Edit) | LBL(GDB Settings) and set LBL(Limit on string chars or
array elements to print).

To see the EMPH(actual) type of a C++ object in GDB, enable
LBL(Set printing of object's derived type based on vtable info)
in the GDB settings (LBL(Edit) | LBL(GDB Settings)).

To display VAR(data) in hexadecimal format, display it and choose
LBL(Convert to Hex) from the LBL(New Display) menu, or enter 
KBD(graph display /x VAR(data)) at the GDB prompt.

To send a signal to the debuggee, use the GDB SAMP(signal) command.
For instance, to continue execution with an interrupt signal, use
KBD(signal SIGINT) or KBD(signal 2) at the GDB prompt.

You can repeat the last command by hitting KEY_RETURN in the @GDB@ console.
With KEY(Ctrl+R) and KEY(Ctrl+S), you can search the command history.

In GCC, SAMP(-Wall) does not enable all warnings.  See the GCC
documentation for other warnings you might consider useful.

To get a global idea of what a process or program does or is doing,
use a system call tracer, like strace, truss, or trace.

# Advanced tips.

You can have each of DDD, @GDB@ and the debugged program run on
different machines.  See the DDD KBD(--rhost) option for details.

To save and restore data displays, cut, copy and paste them via the
LBL(Edit) menu.  Together with CODE(xclipboard), you can manage
arbitrary collections of data displays.

To stop this debugging session and resume later, use 
LBL(File) | LBL(Save Session).

To debug a child process, put a call to SAMP(sleep) in the child right
after the SAMP(fork) call.  Run the program and use LBL(File) |
LBL(Attach to Process) to attach to the child process.

If you suspect memory corruption caused by problematic pointers, try
linking with Electric Fence (SAMP(efence)) or the SAMP(dbmalloc) library
(URL(http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/zorn/public_html/MallocDebug.html)).

Prevention is better than cure.  Document your assumptions using
CODE(<assert.h>) or GNU NANA 
(URL(http://wattle.cs.ntu.edu.au/homepages/pjm/nana-home/)).

You can define your own DDD buttons via LBL(Commands) | LBL(Edit Buttons).

The debugger isn't a substitute for good thinking.  But, in some
cases, thinking isn't a substitute for a good debugger either.  The
most effective combination is good thinking and a good debugger.
QUOTE(Steve McConnell, Code Complete)

When debugging an X application, there is always a risk of
interrupting it while the mouse pointer is grabbed (frozen).  To
prevent this, set LBL(Edit) | LBL(Preferences) | LBL(General) |
LBL(Ungrab mouse pointer when interrupting modal X application).

A simple way to resume a saved DDD VAR(session) is KBD(ddd =VAR(session)).

When you're totally stuck, try to find a helpful ear.  In my experience,
nothing helps you more in debugging than to try to explain your problem
(what your code should do, and what it actually does) to someone else.
