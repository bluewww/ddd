DDD Contributors					-*- text -*-
****************

Besides Dorothea LÜtkehaus and Andreas Zeller, many people have
contributed to the success of DDD.  Starring in historical order,

    CHRISTIAN LINDIG implemented the graph layout algorithm and the export
	facilities.

    RALF GUTSCHE was the first DDD beta tester and made it run on Solaris
	and colour displays.  He is not reponsible for the colour settings,
	though.

    JÜRGEN SCHÖNWÄLDER realized the `ddd-users' mailing list and 
        provided substantial hints for distributing DDD binaries.

    DARRYL HOUSE was the first to make DDD run on a Linux machine and
	reported substantial Solaris bugs.

    MARTIN KOHLSCHMIDT provided substantial hints for distributing DDD
	binaries.

    MICHAEL BUSSIECK and NEAL BECKER were the first to make DDD run on
	HP-UX machines and reported configuration bugs.

    STEFAN MÜLLER and BAS V. DE BAKKER were the first to make DDD run
        on AIX machines and provided appropriate patches.

Thanks to all others who are not mentioned here and helped in the
success of DDD.
