    CHRISTIAN LINDIG implemented the graph layout algorithm and the export
	facilities.

    RALF GUTSCHE was the first DDD beta tester and made it run on Solaris
	and colour displays.  He is not reponsible for the colour settings,
	though.

    JÜRGEN SCHÖNWÄLDER realized the `ddd-users' mailing list and 
        provided substantial hints for distributing DDD binaries.

	reported substantial Solaris bugs.

        and reported configuration bugs.

        on AIX machines and provided appropriate patches.

    KENT WILLIAMS made DDD run on SGI/IRIX machines.

    GRANT McDORMAN run purify on DDD, discovering many memory leaks
        and bad memory references.
