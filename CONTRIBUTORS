Besides Dorothea LÜtkehaus and Andreas Zeller, many people have
contributed to the success of DDD.  Starring in historical order,

    CHRISTIAN LINDIG implemented the graph layout algorithm and the export
	facilities.

    RALF GUTSCHE was the first DDD beta tester and made it run on Solaris
	and colour displays.  He is not reponsible for the colour settings,
	though.

    JÜRGEN SCHÖNWÄLDER realized the `ddd-users' mailing list and 
        provided substantial hints for distributing DDD binaries.

    DARRYL HOUSE was the first to make DDD run on a Linux machine and
	reported substantial Solaris bugs.

    MARTIN KOHLSCHMIDT provided substantial hints for distributing DDD
	binaries.

        and reported configuration bugs.

    STEFAN MÜLLER and BAS V. DE BAKKER were the first to make DDD run
        on AIX machines and provided appropriate patches.

    KENT WILLIAMS made DDD run on SGI/IRIX machines.

    GRANT McDORMAN run purify on DDD, discovering many memory leaks
        and bad memory references.  He also contributed significant
        extensions for DBX 3.x.

    PAUL RAINES found out what made DDD crash on Linux and provided a
        DDD binary linked with fixed Motif libraries.

    CARSTEN KRABIELL and PETRA FUNK were the most toughest beta
        testers ever found and made many substantial suggestions.
