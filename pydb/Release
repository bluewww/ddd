Pydb is a modified version of the standard Python debugger, pdb, with a number
of augmented features that make it suitable for use with DDD, the Data
Display Debugger.

DDD is an X-Windows based front end that provides a uniform way of
using a number of debuggers, including gdb, xdb, jdb (for java), and
now, pydb.  DDD allows one to place a breakpoint by clicking on a line
of code, drag breakpoints, install temporary breakpoints, edit
breakpoints, etc.  DDD also provides a graphical display of variables
which are updated as each breakpoint is triggered.

DDD is a mature program that runs on a large number of platforms.
The version available here is based on DDD-3.0 (released June, 1998) and
modified to support pydb.  More information on DDD is available at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd">DDD's home page</A>.

In the course of connecting the Python debugger pdb to DDD, a number of
changes were required.  As a result, the new version of pdb, pydb, now
supports temporary breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, and an ignore
breakpoint count.  Also, it is now easy to set breakpoints in modules
outside the current one: that is, you can issue a command such as
'break whrandom.random' assuming the module whrandom.py can be found
somewhere in sys.path.  Breakpoints can be disabled and re-enabled.
Since Pydb does not depend on DDD, it can be used stand alone, like pdb.

This is a first release; perfection won't be attained until the n'th
release (where n is undefined).

Two distributions are available.  Both contain all the Python code
along with documentation for DDD.  One release contains DDD as a
compiled binary for Solaris 2.6 (using gcc 2.8.1).  The other contains
the DDD source code modified for Python.  If DDD compiles on your
system, this modified version will (should!); it just takes a while (almost
3 hours on my sparc 5 85Mhz) as DDD is not small.
