DDD 3.0 [in beta test]
----------------------

    DDD 3.0 brings a new look, Java support, and JDB support.

    User-visible changes to DDD 2.2.3:
    - New, `clean' look.  The DDD 2.x button rows are replaced by an
      icon toolbar at the top, saving vertical and horizontal space.
    - Configurable fonts.  You can now easily customize DDD font
      families and font sizes. Try `Edit | Preferences | Fonts'.
    - JDB support.  DDD now also supports JDB as inferior debugger.
      All important JDB features are available via the GUI.
    - Java support.  Requires GDB 4.17 or later (or JDB, of course).
      All data display features are available in Java.
    - Watchpoints.  You can have the debugged program stop
      automatically whenever a particular variable is read or written.
    - Deferred displays.  DDD now can maintain displays whose creation
      is deferred until a particular scope is entered.  Benefits:
      * Displays are now persistent across recompilations.
      * In sessions, displays can also be restored without core dump.
    - Tear-off menus are supported (and enabled by default).
    - Breakpoint properties.  There is an editor panel to set and
      change all properties for a breakpoint at once.
    - Breakpoint commands.  You can record and edit commands to be
      executed when a breakpoint is reached.
    - On popular demand, the command tool now has `until' and `make'
      buttons.
    - Conditional breakpoints, temporary breakpoints, and breakpoints
      with ignore counts now have their special symbols on their own.
    - All selection dialogs, including the breakpoint and display
      editors, now can be resized.
    - When detecting a grabbed (frozen) mouse pointer after reaching a
      breakpoint, DDD now automatically continues execution, rather
      than attempting to ungrab the pointer.
    - Improved help system: In accordance with the Motif style guide,
      F1 invokes help on the item pointed at, while Shift+F1 lets you
      choose an item.
    - Tips of the day.  Upon startup, DDD shows a useful hint for DDD usage.
    - Value tips and selections now work for struct members, too: you
      can point at `A.B' or `A->B' and get the current value.
    - You can have the most important dialogs be realized as
      non-transient windows, allowing the DDD main window ro obscure
      them.  See the `transientDialogs' resource for details.
    - The maximum number of glyphs is now configurable at startup time.
      See the `maxGlyphs' resource for details.
    - DDD no longer indents the source code, leaving more horizontal
      space.  To change this, see `Edit | Preferences | Source |
      Source indentation'.
    - Saving options is much, much faster.
    - DBX settings now also work with SGI DBX.

    Bug fixes:
    - Data displays are no longer cluttered by Sun DBX 3.0 warnings.
    - Paned window management has been improved a lot.
    - DDD now works around a Motif 2.1/XFree86 bug that caused glyphs
      to disappear.  See the `cacheGlyphImages' resource for details.
      (This bug could be fixed thanks to Trond Eivind Glomsrød
      <teg@pvv.ntnu.no> who donated a copy of Motif 2.1 for Linux)
    - The `endless scrolling' problem may now be prevented by delaying
      glyph updates.  See the `glyphUpdateDelay' resource for details.
    - DDD no longer terminates the inferior debugger when receiving an 
      EOF on input.   See the `terminateOnEOF' resource for details.
    - The new grab detection mechanism no longer interferes with grabs
      on Motif popup and pulldown menus.
    - One-letter options like `-b BPS' or `-x FILE' work again.
    - Trailing CRs in debuggee output are now properly handled.

    Changes in configuration and building:
    - LessTif 0.83 is supported (and a standard test environment of
      the DDD developers).  See `patches/' for some useful patches.
    - GDB 4.17 is supported.

    Compatibility notes:
    - Some resources were renamed for clarity:
      The `toolBar' resource is now named `commandToolBar'.
      The `colorIcons' resource is now named `colorWMIcons'.
      Please rename all references to these DDD resources.
    - To enable a DDD 2.x style window layout, use

	Ddd*commonToolBar:    off
	Ddd*toolbarsAtBottom: on

      in your `~/.ddd/init' file.  For a full DDD 2.x look, disable images
      and captions via `Edit | Preferences | Startup | Toolbar Appareance'.

    And once more, several more minor improvements and bug fixes; see
    the `ChangeLog' file for details.


DDD 2.2.3
---------

    DDD 2.2.3 fixes some problems reported for DDD 2.2.2:
    - `struct' recognition with DBX now works again.  (This one was serious.)
    - `configure' now checks for correct ISO C++ <stdexcept>.
    - DDD now runs under the `tvtwm' virtual desktop.
    - DBX Settings now work with Solaris DBX.


DDD 2.2.2
---------

    DDD 2.2.2 brings improved FORTRAN support, improvements in the
    data display and fixes some minor bugs introduced in DDD 2.2.

    User-visible changes to DDD 2.2.1:
    - Improved FORTRAN support.  When debugging FORTRAN programs with
      GDB, DDD now supports FORTRAN array indexing syntax, FORTRAN
      pointer recognition, and lookup of FORTRAN functions with
      trailing underscore `_'.
    - The data display is now scope-sensitive: displays are
      automatically hidden as they become inactive (out of scope) and
      redisplayed as they become active again.  This is handy when
      maintaining a multitude of displays in different scopes.  For
      details, see the `hideInactiveDisplays' resource.
    - Faster data exploration.  Double-clicking...
      * ...on a pointer value: dereferences it.
      * ...on a partially hidden value: shows more detail.
      * ...on a fully shown value: hides it again.
    - A display resize (due to value changes) now automatically
      `bumps' adjacent displays such that they are not obscured;
      see the `bumpDisplays' resource for details.
    - Case-insensitive search in the source text is now supported;
      see the `findCaseSensitive' resource for details.

    Bug fixes:
    - Getting and identifying core dumps now works on Solaris, AIX and
      other architectures.
    - `Edit' no longer causes DDD to crash.
    - The separate execution TTY now works with Sun DBX 4.0.
    - Improved XDB support.  XDB output no longer causes DDD to hang.
    - Improved SGI DBX support.  File positions are now recognized;
      DBX Settings work, too.
    - Various quirks and memory leaks in the interaction between DDD
      and the inferior debugger have been fixed.

    Changes in debugging DDD:
    - The interaction between DDD and the inferior debugger is now
      logged in `~/.ddd/log'.  This is useful for bug reports.
    - DDD dumps core upon fatal errors (but resumes execution).
      This is useful for bug reports.

    Changes in configuration and building:
    - GCC 2.8.0 is supported.

    There are also some more minor improvements and bug fixes; see the
    `ChangeLog' file for details.



DDD 2.2.1
---------

    DDD 2.2.1 fixes some minor bugs introduced in DDD 2.2.

    User-visible changes to DDD 2.2:
    - When saving a session, you can now select the method for getting
      core files.  This is useful on Solaris and SunOS systems.

    Bug fixes:
    - Auto-raised menus have caused problems on some architectures:
      they are now disabled by default.  Use `Ddd*autoRaiseMenu: true'
      in `~/.ddd/init' to re-enable them.
    - By default, DDD stops disassembling after 1024 bytes.  This is
      useful when working with the machine code of huge functions.
      See the `maxDisassemble' resource for more info.
    - Several status and diagnostic messages have been reworked; they
      now show the outcome of a command.
    - DDD now works around a bug present in Linux libc 5.4.38 to
      5.4.40 that prevented DDD <-> GDB communication.
    - The `gcore' method for getting core files is now fully supported.
    - Various glitches in command queue management have been fixed:
      * Interacting with the debuggee (or interrupting it) now
        properly discards pending debugger commands.
      * In `--tty' mode, DDD can now handle long command sequences.
        This is useful when running DDD from Emacs.
      * In `--tty' mode, you can now send EOF (^D) characters to the
        debugged program without having DDD terminate GDB.
    - Trying to open non-existent source files no longer confuses GDB.
    - When running in the background, DDD is no longer interrupted by
      `tty output' signals upon initializing the execution window.
    - PushButton menus work with LessTif >= 0.82 and with OSF/Motif 1.1.
    - Command tool decoration has been improved and should now work
      with all X window managers.

    Changes in configuration and building:
    - GNU libiberty and the GNU configure scripts are now up-to-date.
    - The EGCS C++ compiler is supported (see `http://www.cygnus.com/egcs/').

    There are also some more minor improvements and bug fixes.  See
    the `ChangeLog' file for details.



DDD 2.2
-------

    DDD 2.2 brings persistent sessions, an improved user interface,
    attaching to running processes, display shortcuts, and more.

    User-visible changes to DDD 2.1:
    - Persistent sessions.
      * You can now save the entire debugger and process state and
        resume the session later.
      * Saved state includes process memory and state, inferior
        debugger settings, breakpoints, and data displays.
      * X11R6 sessions are supported, too.  When used with a
        session manager, DDD saves and restores its entire state.
      * Persistent sessions work best with GDB; DBX and XDB are
        partially supported, too.
    - Improved user interface.
      * DDD now requires less width and height.
      * Source line numbers have been turned off (can be restored);
        the breakpoint area extends to the first non-blank character.
      * The `Disable ()' button for disabling displays has gone;
        displays are now enabled or disabled via `Show ()/Hide ()'.
      * The `Break at ()' and `Clear at ()' buttons have been merged
        into one single dynamic button.
      * The `Windows' menu is now called `View', complying with the
        Motif style guide.
      * Options are now grouped according to their functionality.  The
        `Options' menu has gone.  Use `Edit' instead.
      * The `Edit' menu has been completely rewritten, allowing for
        better clipboard operations.  For instance, you can now copy
        selected displays to the clipboard and paste them later.
      * Several buttons provide new pulldown menus with useful functions.
    - Improved command tool.
      * The command tool is always auto-raised, i.e. placed on top of
        the DDD windows.
      * The command tool always comes with window manager decorations, 
        such that you can easily move it around.
      * The command tool sticks to the DDD source window: if you move
        the DDD source window around, the command tool follows.
    - Display shortcuts.  Once you have changed `p' to `(char *) p'
      manually, DDD provides a menu shortcut for converting arbitrary
      values to `(char *)'.
    - Button editor.  User-defined buttons can now be defined,
      changed, and deleted at run-time.
    - Support for debugging processes running outside of DDD.  You can
      attach to a running process, examine it, and resume execution.
    - Helper customization.  You can now interactively select and
      customize the applications to be used for the execution window,
      for editing source code, for browsing the DDD WWW page, etc.
    - Improved online manuals.
      * Multiple manual browsers are supported.
      * Manual browsers are realized as top-level windows.
      * DDD no longer blocks while the manual is uncompressed and formatted.
      * DDD stores manuals in `gzip' format, saving space in executables.
    - New `What Now?' help.  Gives a hint on what you can do next,
      depending on the current DDD state.  Useful for beginners.
    - Improved data display.
      * Displayed data is highlighted whenever it changes.
      * Two-dimensional arrays are now laid out as tables.
      * Numerical values are now aligned to the right.
      * You can now incrementally `Show More' details of an object,
        instead of showing all details at once.
      * Processing displays can be interrupted by typing Ctrl+C.
    - Drag and drop support.
      * You can now alter the current execution position interactively
        by dragging and dropping the execution arrow.  This allows you
        to back up - perhaps with more breakpoints set-over a portion
        of a program that has already executed, in order to examine
        its execution in more detail.
      * Breakpoints can be dragged and dropped, too.  This allows you
        to move breakpoints to alternate positions, without changing
        their properties.
    - Improved display of breakpoints and execution positions.
      * The current execution position is now properly cleared if
        undetermined (no source, program terminated, etc.)
      * If the program stopped due to a signal, this is indicated
        by a lightning symbol within the current execution glyph.
      * Faster scrolling.  While scrolling source or machine code at
        high speed, glyphs are now unmapped.  Slow scrolling still
        shows glyphs.
    - Improved DBX and XDB support.
      * DDD supports DBX and XDB breakpoint conditions.
      * With SUN DBX 3.x, DDD also supports disabled breakpoints 
        and ignore counts.
    - User-defined DDD commands.  DDD now provides a simple facility
      that allows the inferior debugger to execute DDD commands.  For
      details, see `User-Defined Commands' in the DDD manual.
    - For `Continue Until Here', DDD now sets a temporary breakpoint
      and continues (instead of using the GDB `until' command).  If
      the temporary breakpoint is not reached, it is deleted.
    - When restarting DDD, all settings (data displays, execution
      position, etc.) are preserved.
    - When DDD becomes ready after a user command, it automatically
      uniconifies itself.  Hence, you can iconify DDD while it runs a
      program; DDD pops up again as soon as a breakpoint is hit.
    - Characters typed into the data and source windows are now
      forwarded to the debugger console.
    - Resource files have been renamed.  All files are now located
      under `~/.ddd/'.  The file `~/.dddinit' has been replaced by
      `~/.ddd/init'; `~/.ddd_history' is now `~/.ddd/history'.  The
      new directory `~/.ddd/sessions/' contains saved DDD sessions.
    - Your window manager should now show multi-color DDD icons.
      (requires XPM; can be disabled)
    - During start-up, DDD shows a multi-color logo in a transient
      window. (requires XPM; can be disabled)
    - DDD now typically requires 35% less memory.  This was achieved
      by compiling and optimizing DDD regular expressions at compile
      time, rather than generating them at run time.

    Supported platforms and configurations:
    - Support for Linux with GNU libc 5.4.38 and later included.
    - Support for XDB on HP-UX 10.x included.  Thanks to Robert
      Wiegand <wiegand@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov>.
    - Support for SUN DBX 3.2 included.

    Bug fixes:
    - DDD no longer hangs while receiving large chunks of data.
    - DDD now also works with echoing TTY connections.
    - Significant speed-ups in processing debugger and program output.
    - Several memory leaks and X resource leaks have been tightened.
    - DDD no longer requires the librx library.  Consequently, librx
      errors can no more cause DDD to crash.
    - A serious bug that caused timers to be inadvertently removed has
      been fixed.  Bug effects included loss of console cursor, loss
      of data display contents, and loss of scrolling capabilities.
    - DDD now handles GDB `<repeats N times>' output correctly.
    - And again, hundreds of minor improvements and bug fixes.  See
      the ChangeLog for details.


DDD 2.1.1
---------

    DDD 2.1.1 includes some hacks that make DDD run with LessTif, a
    free Motif clone, without loss of functionality.  DDD now no more
    depends on proprietary software like OSF/Motif.

    Apart from these hacks, functionality is unchanged with respect to
    DDD 2.1 (no new features, no bug fixes).  If you have DDD 2.1 up
    and running, there is no need to upgrade to DDD 2.1.1.

    As of this release, DDD is included in GNU CD-ROMs by the Free
    Software Foundation (aka the GNU people).  DDD distributions are
    now numbered according to the GNU Maintenance Instructions.



DDD 2.1
-------

    DDD 2.1 brings alias detection, local variable displays, button
    and value tips as well as several new features and bug fixes.

    User-visible changes to DDD 2.0:
    - Alias detection.	DDD now recognizes that multiple displays
      reference the same object.  This allows the examination of
      shared data structures (circular lists, DAGs, and so on).	 Alias
      detection slows down DDD a bit, so it is turned off by default.
    - Local variable displays.	You can display all local variables
      and arguments in the data display.  The display is automatically
      updated to reflect the list of variables and their values.
    - Status displays.	You can now view the output of a debugger
      command in the data window, using "graph display `COMMAND`".
      For instance, local variable displays are realized via
      "graph display `info locals`".
    - Button tips.  Moving the mouse pointer over a button causes a
      small hint window (aka `balloon help') to raise.	(optional)
    - Value tips.  Moving the mouse pointer over a variable causes a
      small window to raise showing the current value.	(optional)
    - The status line has been reworked and extended:
      * It displays information about the selected item.
      * It has moved to the bottom, such that menu entries can be
	described.  (can be restored)
      * It contains a debugger status indicator, blinking whenever
	the inferior debugger is busy.	(can be turned off)
      * You can re-display the most recent messages.
    - The register window can display floating-point registers.
    - Thread support.  You can inquire existing threads and switch
      among them.  (requires GDB and operating system thread support)
    - In `one single window' mode (now default), you can disable
      specific window parts (e.g. data displays, debugger console,
      etc.) through the `Windows' menu.
    - The `Preferences' panel has been extended and reworked:
      * Button tips and value tips can be enabled and disabled.
      * Tab width and graph grid size can now be changed at run time.
      * You can choose at run time whether command buttons should 
	be placed in the command tool (as in DDD 2.0) or in the 
	source window (as in DDD 1.x).
      * You can reset the DDD preferences to the least recently saved
	settings.
    - Some items have been renamed for clarity:
      * The `Stack' menu is now named `Status', as it hosts other
	status-related items besides backtrace and registers.
      * The `Break' button is now named `Interrupt' (as in DDD 1.x),
	to avoid confusion with the `Break At' button.
      * The `Quit' menu item is now named `Abort', to avoid confusion
	with the `Exit' menu item (which issues a `quit' command).
    - Some key bindings have been re-assigned.	Generally, `Ctrl'
      invokes debugger or editing commands, and `Alt' changes debugger
      settings.	 Hence, Ctrl+M invokes `make' and Ctrl+Q invokes
      `quit', while Alt+M enables or disables the machine code window.
      `Run' is now on Ctrl+X (for eXecute).
    - DBX settings can now be viewed and changed at run time, using
      the `Settings' panel.
    - In GDB, there is a `status displays' panel for displaying 
      various things about the program being debugged.
    - Reading the VSL library is now realized as a background job,
      reducing startup time drastically.
    - In the data window, the middle mouse button now toggles 
      the display selection instead of simply extending it.
    - The most important data window operations can now also be
      invoked via the debugger console.	 For instance, the command
      `graph display *next at (50, 50) dependent on 1' creates a new
      dependent display at (50, 50).  In the long term, this feature
      will be used to save and restore display state.
    - In the debugger console, the right mouse button invokes a small
      popup menu which you can use to clear the line or the window.
    - Ever suffered from a frozen display while debugging a modal
      application?  If the debugged program is interrupted in some
      modal state, DDD will automatically make it ungrab the pointer.
    - You can now clear all argument fields `()' by clicking on the
      prompt `():'.
    - In the source argument field `()', pressing RETURN activates
      the `Lookup ()' button.
    - `Save Options' saves window sizes for later DDD sessions, as
      well as the relative position of the command tool.
    - Unnecessary redisplays have been significantly reduced, causing
      much less flickering.
    - If you specify some overloaded or ambiguous identifier, DDD now
      lets you select from all alternatives.
    - Buttons not supported on certain debuggers (for instance,
      `Finish' on DBX) are now made insensitive.  (optional)
    - You can now invoke `make' from DDD, reusing old `make' arguments
      from the command history if desired.
    - There is a new integrated manual browser showing manual pages
      and info files for DDD as well as for the inferior debugger.
      A simple search facility is also included.

    Documentation:
    - The PostScript copy of the manual has been enriched with more
      than 30 color screen shots showing DDD usage.
    - A `sample.dddinit' file is included in the distribution
      containing several examples for further customization.

    Changes in configuration and building:
    - DDD 2.1 uses improved configuration checks from Autoconf 2.12.
    - DDD no longer installs in the `gcc' location by default, but in
      an existing DDD location; otherwise, in `/usr/local/bin'.
    - Improved means of determining builder's e-mail address.
    - DDD beta releases and DDD snapshots expire after a few weeks.

    Bug fixes:
    - Using DBX, comments were stripped from source code under certain
      circumstances.  Fixed.
    - The sash to resize the assembler window is back again.
    - With XDB, sources are found in alternate directories, too.
    - With DBX, the current source line was omitted from the listing
      under certain circumstances.  Fixed.
    - With Sun DBX, DDD uses the DBX display numbers instead of
      generating own numbers.
    - `Help on Version' no longer includes the entire DDD
      configuration.
    - Several single-letter options like `-d DIR' are now properly
      passed down to the inferior debugger.
    - `Select All' followed by `Delete' no more causes DDD to crash.
    - Problems with button specs ending in `...' have been fixed.
    - Line continuations (i.e. lines ending in `\') are properly handled.
    - Problems in building the `vsl' and `test-graph' programs are fixed.
    - On Linux, drag-and-drop of pixmaps has been disabled explicitly.
      (Several Linux Motif configurations are broken in this aspect.)
    - DDD now sets the WM_COMMAND resource such that X session
      managers can save and restore DDD state.
    - The data window now uses a command queue for operations on data
      displays.	 No more `The debugger is busy' messages.
    - Improved handling of template-generated class names and
      optimized-out structs.
    - And again, dozens of minor bug fixes and improvements.

    Release policy:
    - Due to the large amount of testing, we make new DDD releases
      only every six months or so.  If you found a bug and fixed it
      for us or just reported it to us so we could fix it, then this
      release scheme may not be good enough for you.  Therefore, we
      now also have a daily snapshot of our CVS repository.  See the
      DDD WWW page `http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/' for details.
