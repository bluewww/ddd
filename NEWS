DDD 1.0
-------

First public DDD release.  Many thanks to all who spent their time in
testing DDD, sending bug reports and suggestions, and making DDD what
it is today.

This DDD release should configure, compile and run out-of-the-box on
the following systems:

    hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.05 
    linux-i386-unknown
    linux-i486-unknown
    mips-dec-ultrix4
    powerpc-ibm-aix3
    rs6000-ibm-aix3
    sparc-sun-sunos4
    sparc-sun-solaris2

If your system is in the list above, please let us know if you
encountered any problems (unless these are known problems listed in
the `BUGS' and `PROBLEMS' files).  If your system is not in the list
above, please let us share your experiences.

Changes to DDD 0.9:
- New `Program' menu, introduces keyboard accelerators for frequently
  used commands.
- Graph printing reworked; you can now set paper size and graph
  orientation.  The bounding box is computed correctly for all sizes.
- The `Graph' menu has been dropped; its items have been moved 
  into the `Data' and `File' menus.
- Selecting and moving multiple displays made easier.
- Pointers to functions are now displayed correctly.
- Regex name conflicts on Linux fixed.

Announce policy for future releases:
- Bug fix releases shall be named 1.0a, 1.0b, and so on.
  In general, they will be announced in DDD mailing lists only.
- Feature releases shall be numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and so on.
  They will be announced in USENET news as well.


DDD 0.9.9
---------

Definitively the last beta release before DDD 1.0, which is scheduled
for May 7th, 1995.  This release fixes sime minor bugs introduced by
porting DDD on other machines (the AIX patches made DDD not run on
HP-UX; the HP-UX patches made DDD not run on ULTRIX, and so on...).


DDD 0.9.8
---------

General Features:
- Improved auto-configuration for HP-UX and Solaris.
- Pascal and Modula-2 support for DBX completed.

User Interface:
- Foreground color explictly set to black.
- New `Stack' menu (the `Source' menu may grow in time).

Sources are now under CVS revision control.  This implies a large diff
to earlier releases, but the DDD distribution itself has shrinked a
lot due to stripped RCS Logs.  Changes are now recorded in top-level
`ChangeLog' files.


DDD 0.9.7
---------

General Features:
- Full DBX support, including graphical data display.  Nearly all
  features of DDD/GDB could also be realized in DDD/DBX.  With DBX,
  GDB supports debugging programs written in C, C++, Pascal and
  Modula-2.  DBX support has only been tested on SUNs yet (SunOS and
  Solaris); let us share your experiences from other DBX vendors (AIX?).
- Improved inter-process communication; DDD gives less spurious
  warnings and retries failed writing attempts.
- DDD can be invoked as `ddd --check-configuration' for a full X
  configuration check.
- Some fixes for HP-UX and AIX were applied.

User Interface:
- Improved help texts.
- Global TAB completion is now ``on'' by default.

Data Display:
- Improved expression parser.  Arrays of structs are now parsed
  correctly; Pascal and Modula-2 expressions are parsed as well.
- DDD is much more robust, should display types or sizes change.
  DDD is also much more robust regarding the debugger output format.
- Attempt to dereference illegal pointers is now handled correctly
  (a bug introduced in DDD 0.9.3).
- Minor improvements in display rendering.


DDD 0.9.6
---------

General Features:
- DDD now has a menu `General Options', where you can set up defaults
  for the next invocation of DDD.  This includes keyboard policy,
  debugger type and some more.
- Due to various complaints, the default keyboard focus policy is
  pointer-driven again.  To change the policy, use the `General
  Options' menu.



DDD 0.9.5
---------

All planned and suggested features are now realized; the only feature
still missing is graphical data display for DBX.

Installation:
- The `configure' options for setting paths for Motif and Athena
  widgets and libraries should now work correctly.

General Features:
- DDD is now more robust when several commands are entered in a row.

User Interface:
- DDD now supports both ``click-to-type'' and ``point-to-type''
  keyboard focus policies.  Default is taken from user's preference.
- Main window menu bar rearranged.
- New backtrace viewer for simple stack frame selection.
- New command history viewer for simple history navigation.
- Dialog titles correctly set-up.
- No `mwm' resize handles for transient windows.

Data Display:
- Displays can be selected (Cursor keys) and moved (Shift + Cursor
  key) using the keyboard.
- Panner supports keyboard traversal.
- Display auto-selection upon creation and deletion.
- Show/Hide Detail can be applied to display groups.
- Panner resize policy further improved.
- Double-click on a display selects all connected displays.

Miscellaneous:
- Call for picture postcards.  See `Help/On Version...' for details.


DDD 0.9.4
---------

A single minor enhancement, suggested by a Linux user:

Internals:
- To make DDD less dependent on OS-specific signal handling,
  asynchronous signal processing has been disabled.  This should not
  make any visible difference (except that running DDD should now
  cause less problems on some architectures).



DDD 0.9.3
---------

Some minor bug fixes and enhancements.  Again, all reported bugs have
been fixed (except for those listed in `ddd/BUGS').

Installation:
- DDD is now correctly installed in the $(exec_prefix)/bin directory
  (usually /usr/local/bin).

General Features:
- A pre-formatted version of the DDD manual is now compiled into DDD.
  This prevents unwanted dependencies from the local `man' program.
- DDD now determines X locations and settings upon start-up.  This
  facilitates distribution of binaries.
- Local file lookup (via the `File' menu) has been sped up
  considerably.
- DDD checks the version of app-defaults and ~/.dddinit files against
  its own.
- The new default for program execution is *not* to use a separate
  execution window, since this still causes trouble on some systems.
- DDD now by default uses the GDB `tty' command to redirect process I/O.
- For security reasons, DDD can not be invoked as setuid program.

User Interface:
- Improved panner geometry and location.  Panners can no longer
  obscure the entire data window.
- Improved selection mechanism.  Detail can now be hidden for
  arbitrary items, making it possible to hide large string detail.
- More options can now be set and changed at run-time, such as group
  iconification and separate execution window.
- DDD has a new logo, showing a real bug.
- There is a button for quick and painless application killing.
- The run and interrupt buttons have less aggressive colors.
- The hourglass is smaller.


DDD 0.9.2
---------

A major bug fix release.  All reported bugs have been fixed (except for
those listed in `ddd/BUGS').  This release is very close to final
(that is, DDD 1.0); last features being added do DDD 1.0 are marked
``work in progress'' in `ddd/WISHES'.

Installation:
- Improved configuration: looks for Motif and Athena in many popular
  places.  Several `configure' bugs have been fixed.  DDD should now
  configure and build out-of-the-box on most systems.

General Features:
- DDD has been prepared for DBX support.  Breakpoints work, displays
  don't yet.  DBX support will be completed in DDD 1.0.
- Persistent options.  Users can set resources in individual
  ~/.dddinit files.
- Improved TTY redirection.  By default, DDD now uses the GDB `tty'
  command for redirection to the separate execution window.

User Interface:
- Improved command and argument completion a la `zsh': First TAB
  expands up to common prefix, second TAB lists expansions, third and
  further TAB skips through expansions.
- `Help Index' invokes a DDD manual page browser.
- The `Find' buttons have been renamed to `Search'.
- DDD has its own logos and icons.
- Optionally, all DDD windows may be iconified and deiconified as a
  group.  See the `separateIcons' resource for details.

Data Display:
- Display placement improved.  New displays no longer obscure existing
  displays; placement is dependent on parent and parent's descendants.
- Layout sorts nodes according to the display strings.
- Full color display support.

Thanks to all who spent time in testing DDD and sending reports.



DDD 0.9.1 and DDD 0.9.1.a
-------------------------

A ``first bug fixes'' release.

Bugs fixed:
- Some bugs occurring on SVR4 systems (Solaris, HP-UX) were fixed.
- DDD now runs on color displays (DDD 0.9.1a)

User Interface:
- Due to popular request, the `Breakpoints' and `Display' menus have
  been dropped; editor panels were introduced instead.



DDD 0.9.0
---------

First beta DDD release.
