DDD 1.3 (not released yet)
--------------------------

    More and more minor bugs fixed.  See the `ChangeLog' file for
    details.

    Changes to DDD 1.2:
    - DDD now compiles properly using DDD 2.7.0.  It should also
      compile using GCC 2.3.3 (lots of warnings, though) \
      or any later GCC version.
    - DBX support on Solaris improved.  Thanks to grant@isgtec.com
      (Grant McDorman)
    - Patches for FreeBSD incorporated.  Thanks to
      smcarey@mailbox.syr.edu (Shawn M. Carey).
    - DDD-specific application defaults now override user application
      defaults.  Thanks to ksfdo0@ksepl.shell.nl (Fred Donck).
    - `Help on Debugging' item.  Written by David A. Lyons
      (dlyons@apple.com).
    - New GNU librx 0.07.2 library included.


DDD 1.2
-------

    Again, a bug fix release.  Many minor bugs have been fixed; see
    the `ChangeLog' file for details.

    Changes to DDD 1.1:
    - DDD source code should now be ANSI/ISO C++ conformant - all code
      specific to GCC or libg++ has been adapted.  DDD now also
      compiles using other C++ compilers than GCC (Sun's CC 4.0 works
      fine; AT&T Cfront 3.0 has trouble with some inline functions).
    - DDD should now run correctly on SGI/IRIX machines.
    - Interrupting processes via the Interrupt button now works
      correctly on Solaris, HP-UX, and other systems.
    - Improved support for GDB artificial arrays.
    - The GDB command window has improved control character support.
      Tabs, Carriage returns, Backspaces and so on are processed
      correctly.  Unprintable characters are also handled.
    - There is an option to suppress X warnings.  This may be useful
      for people annoyed by tons of Motif Keysym warnings.
    - We have started to compile a FAQ list to reduce our daily mail
      load.  See the file `FAQ' for details.

    Thanks to all who sent in bug reports and suggestions.

    As building DDD is still a major challenge for some users, we
    encourage everyone to share her/his binaries with others.  See the
    file ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de:/pub/local/softech/ddd/bin/README for
    details.


DDD 1.1
-------

    Never trust a ``dot-oh'' release - DDD 1.0 had a serious bug that
    caused DDD to crash upon various occasions, often after a few
    interactions.

    Under certain circumstances and on many architectures, the
    hourglass cursor routines could corrupt the stack at a random
    point and thus throw a time bomb into DDD, making DDD fail at
    unpredictable (and unrepeatable) places.  This bug has been fixed;
    some other minor bugs were fixed, too.  See the `ChangeLog' file
    for details.

    Changes to DDD 1.0:
    - C++ References and VTables are fully supported.
    - The source popup menu no longer changes the source selection.


DDD 1.0a
--------

    Bug fix release.

    On many architectures, this DDD release should be much more
    robust.  For unknown reasons, DDD 1.0 choked soon after destroying
    some of its widgets - a bug that must have been introduced at the
    very end of the beta test phase and thus have gone by unnoticed.
    This bug, and some other minor bugs, have been fixed.



DDD 1.0
-------

    First public DDD release.  Many thanks to all who spent their time
    in testing DDD, sending bug reports and suggestions, and making
    DDD what it is today.
    
    This DDD release should configure, compile and run out-of-the-box
    on the following systems:
    
        hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.05 
        linux-i386-unknown
        linux-i486-unknown
        mips-dec-ultrix4
        powerpc-ibm-aix3
        rs6000-ibm-aix3
        sparc-sun-sunos4
        sparc-sun-solaris2
    
    If your system is in the list above, please let us know if you
    encountered any problems (unless these are known problems listed
    in the `BUGS' and `PROBLEMS' files).  If your system is not in the
    list above, please let us share your experiences.

    Changes to DDD 0.9:
    - Several last-minute bugs have been fixed.
    - New `Program' menu, introduces keyboard accelerators for frequently
      used commands.
    - Graph printing reworked; you can now set paper size and graph
      orientation.  The bounding box is computed correctly for all sizes.
    - The `Graph' menu has been dropped; its items have been moved 
      into the `Data' and `File' menus.
    - Selecting and moving multiple displays made easier.
    - Pointers to functions are now displayed correctly.
    - Regex name conflicts on Linux fixed.

    Announce policy for future releases:
    - Bug fix releases shall be named 1.0a, 1.0b, and so on.
      In general, they will be announced in DDD mailing lists only.
    - Feature releases shall be numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and so on.
      They will be announced in USENET news as well.


DDD 0.9.9
---------

    Definitively the last beta release before DDD 1.0, which is scheduled
    for May 7th, 1995.  This release fixes sime minor bugs introduced by
    porting DDD on other machines (the AIX patches made DDD not run on
    HP-UX; the HP-UX patches made DDD not run on ULTRIX, and so on...).


DDD 0.9.8
---------

    General Features:
    - Improved auto-configuration for HP-UX and Solaris.
    - Pascal and Modula-2 support for DBX completed.

    User Interface:
    - Foreground color explictly set to black.
    - New `Stack' menu (the `Source' menu may grow in time).

    Sources are now under CVS revision control.  This implies a large
    diff to earlier releases, but the DDD distribution itself has
    shrinked a lot due to stripped RCS Logs.  Changes are now recorded
    in top-level `ChangeLog' files.


DDD 0.9.7
---------

    General Features:
    - Full DBX support, including graphical data display.  Nearly all
      features of DDD/GDB could also be realized in DDD/DBX.  With DBX,
      GDB supports debugging programs written in C, C++, Pascal and
      Modula-2.  DBX support has only been tested on SUNs yet (SunOS and
      Solaris); let us share your experiences from other DBX vendors (AIX?).
    - Improved inter-process communication; DDD gives less spurious
      warnings and retries failed writing attempts.
    - DDD can be invoked as `ddd --check-configuration' for a full X
      configuration check.
    - Some fixes for HP-UX and AIX were applied.

    User Interface:
    - Improved help texts.
    - Global TAB completion is now ``on'' by default.

    Data Display:
    - Improved expression parser.  Arrays of structs are now parsed
      correctly; Pascal and Modula-2 expressions are parsed as well.
    - DDD is much more robust, should display types or sizes change.
      DDD is also much more robust regarding the debugger output format.
    - Attempt to dereference illegal pointers is now handled correctly
      (a bug introduced in DDD 0.9.3).
    - Minor improvements in display rendering.


DDD 0.9.6
---------

    General Features:
    - DDD now has a menu `General Options', where you can set up defaults
      for the next invocation of DDD.  This includes keyboard policy,
      debugger type and some more.
    - Due to various complaints, the default keyboard focus policy is
      pointer-driven again.  To change the policy, use the `General
      Options' menu.



DDD 0.9.5
---------

    All planned and suggested features are now realized; the only feature
    still missing is graphical data display for DBX.

    Installation:
    - The `configure' options for setting paths for Motif and Athena
      widgets and libraries should now work correctly.

    General Features:
    - DDD is now more robust when several commands are entered in a row.

    User Interface:
    - DDD now supports both ``click-to-type'' and ``point-to-type''
      keyboard focus policies.  Default is taken from user's preference.
    - Main window menu bar rearranged.
    - New backtrace viewer for simple stack frame selection.
    - New command history viewer for simple history navigation.
    - Dialog titles correctly set-up.
    - No `mwm' resize handles for transient windows.

    Data Display:
    - Displays can be selected (Cursor keys) and moved (Shift + Cursor
      key) using the keyboard.
    - Panner supports keyboard traversal.
    - Display auto-selection upon creation and deletion.
    - Show/Hide Detail can be applied to display groups.
    - Panner resize policy further improved.
    - Double-click on a display selects all connected displays.

    Miscellaneous:
    - Call for picture postcards.  See `Help/On Version...' for details.


DDD 0.9.4
---------

    A single minor enhancement, suggested by a Linux user:

    Internals:
    - To make DDD less dependent on OS-specific signal handling,
      asynchronous signal processing has been disabled.  This should not
      make any visible difference (except that running DDD should now
      cause less problems on some architectures).



DDD 0.9.3
---------

    Some minor bug fixes and enhancements.  Again, all reported bugs have
    been fixed (except for those listed in `ddd/BUGS').

    Installation:
    - DDD is now correctly installed in the $(exec_prefix)/bin directory
      (usually /usr/local/bin).

    General Features:
    - A pre-formatted version of the DDD manual is now compiled into DDD.
      This prevents unwanted dependencies from the local `man' program.
    - DDD now determines X locations and settings upon start-up.  This
      facilitates distribution of binaries.
    - Local file lookup (via the `File' menu) has been sped up
      considerably.
    - DDD checks the version of app-defaults and ~/.dddinit files against
      its own.
    - The new default for program execution is *not* to use a separate
      execution window, since this still causes trouble on some systems.
    - DDD now by default uses the GDB `tty' command to redirect process I/O.
    - For security reasons, DDD can not be invoked as setuid program.
    
    User Interface:
    - Improved panner geometry and location.  Panners can no longer
      obscure the entire data window.
    - Improved selection mechanism.  Detail can now be hidden for
      arbitrary items, making it possible to hide large string detail.
    - More options can now be set and changed at run-time, such as group
      iconification and separate execution window.
    - DDD has a new logo, showing a real bug.
    - There is a button for quick and painless application killing.
    - The run and interrupt buttons have less aggressive colors.
    - The hourglass is smaller.


DDD 0.9.2
---------

    A major bug fix release.  All reported bugs have been fixed (except for
    those listed in `ddd/BUGS').  This release is very close to final
    (that is, DDD 1.0); last features being added do DDD 1.0 are marked
    ``work in progress'' in `ddd/WISHES'.

    Installation:
    - Improved configuration: looks for Motif and Athena in many popular
      places.  Several `configure' bugs have been fixed.  DDD should now
      configure and build out-of-the-box on most systems.

    General Features:
    - DDD has been prepared for DBX support.  Breakpoints work, displays
      don't yet.  DBX support will be completed in DDD 1.0.
    - Persistent options.  Users can set resources in individual
      ~/.dddinit files.
    - Improved TTY redirection.  By default, DDD now uses the GDB `tty'
      command for redirection to the separate execution window.

    User Interface:
    - Improved command and argument completion a la `zsh': First TAB
      expands up to common prefix, second TAB lists expansions, third and
      further TAB skips through expansions.
    - `Help Index' invokes a DDD manual page browser.
    - The `Find' buttons have been renamed to `Search'.
    - DDD has its own logos and icons.
    - Optionally, all DDD windows may be iconified and deiconified as a
      group.  See the `separateIcons' resource for details.

    Data Display:
    - Display placement improved.  New displays no longer obscure existing
      displays; placement is dependent on parent and parent's descendants.
    - Layout sorts nodes according to the display strings.
    - Full color display support.

    Thanks to all who spent time in testing DDD and sending reports.



DDD 0.9.1 and DDD 0.9.1.a
-------------------------

    A ``first bug fixes'' release.

    Bugs fixed:
    - Some bugs occurring on SVR4 systems (Solaris, HP-UX) were fixed.
    - DDD now runs on color displays (DDD 0.9.1a)

    User Interface:
    - Due to popular request, the `Breakpoints' and `Display' menus have
      been dropped; editor panels were introduced instead.



DDD 0.9.0
---------

    First beta DDD release.
