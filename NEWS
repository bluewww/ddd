DDD 1.4b (WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT YET RELEASED)
----------------------------------------------

   Bug fix release.

   Changes to DDD 1.4a:
   - Much faster start-up, due to delayed loading of the VSL library.
   - Busy looping under X11R6 should not happen anymore.
   - Manual update of data display (`graph refresh') improved.
   - `set' and `assign' commands automatically update data display.
   - Building DDD creates executable with canonical name.


DDD 1.4a
--------

   Bug fix release.  No user-visible changes.

   - Compilation trouble with older GCC versions as well as 
     older C++ compilers fixed.
   - Compilation in separate directory fixed.
   - For older GDB versions, one may use `display /x $pc' and `print
     /x $pc' to get the current PC value.
   - Minor bugs in construction and installation fixed.


DDD 1.4
-------

    DDD 1.4 realizes the top ten suggestions of DDD users.  It brings
    the long awaited machine code support, new breakpoint and
    execution symbols, improved DBX support, enhanced integration
    facilities and many small features and improvements.

    Changes to DDD 1.3:
    - Full machine code support: Assembler and register windows,
      Breakpoints in machine code, no-source debugging, stepping over
      instructions.  (GDB only)
    - Breakpoints and the current execution position are displayed as
      stop signs and arrow symbols (``glyphs'') instead of text.  Our
      students find that cute; the old mode is still available.
    - New argument editor: Upon program start, select from a list of
      previously used program arguments.
    - Using the new `--tty' option, DDD can be easily integrated with
      other GDB/DBX front-ends.  For instance, you can have DDD run as
      an inferior debugger from your Emacs GDB-mode, having all Emacs
      and DDD facilities at your disposition.
    - Improved C++ support with DBX 3.x.  Thanks to Grant McDorman
      <grant@isgtec.com>.
    - Displays with format expressions (`/x') are properly
      dereferenced.
    - Improved position history mechanism.
    - Automatic reloading of source files when the debugged program
      has changed; explicit reload is no longer required.
    - File selection dialogs are synchronized: changing the directory
      in one dialog also changes the directory in all others.
    - Interactive dialogs for disambiguating C++ names.
    - Several major and minor bugs have been fixed.  Special thanks to
      Grant McDorman <grant@isgtec.com>.
    - DDD incorporates the name of its builder in `Help/Show Version'.
    - No more `Help on Debugging' item.  Sigh.


DDD 1.3e
--------

    Bug fix release.

    - Some compilation trouble with older GCC versions as well as
      older C++ compilers fixed; thanks to Albert Chin-A-Young
      <chinay@cig.mot.com>.
    - Some configuration trouble with non-GCC compilers and Motif 2.0
      fixed; thanks to Larry Schwimmer <rosebud@cyclone.stanford.edu>.
      GNU Autoconf 2.7 is now used.
    - Functionality is unchanged; executables are identical.


DDD 1.3d
--------

    Bug fix release.

    - Anonymous unions and bitfields are now processed correctly.
    - `Continue Until Here' (was `Set Temporary and Continue')
      now also stops if current stack frame is left (GDB only)
    - More patches for Linux ELF incorporated.  Thanks to 
      lee@tcs.com (Lee Hounshell) and jdassen@wi.leidenuniv.nl (J.H.M. Dassen)
    - Non-textual source files (binary characters, no newline at end)
      are now processed correctly.
    - Basic support for DEC's dbx included.


DDD 1.3c
--------

    Bug fix release.

    - Patches for GCC 2.7.1 incorporated.
    - Patches for recent Linux boxes (using ELF format) incorporated.
      Thanks to lee@champion.tcs.co.jp (Lee Hounshell).
    - Patches for DEC Alpha OSF/1 incorporated; see the `PROBLEMS'
      file for special building instructions.  Thanks to
      tuppa@iue.tuwien.ac.at (Walter Tuppa)
    - Configuration scripts reworked for GNU autoconf 2.6; various
      configuration bugs have been fixed.

    - New shortcuts in source popup menus:
      * The breakpoint popup menu allows you to set a temporary 
	breakpoint and continue immediately.
	Suggested by Chris Sterritt <sterritt@mrj.com>
      * The source popup menu allows you to print or display
	dereferenced names (`print *' and `display *').  Suggested by
	Walter Tuppa <tuppa@iue.tuwien.ac.at>

    - All DDD source code (except `ddd.C') now comes under the GNU
      general public *library* license.  This means that the following
      is now allowed under certain circumstances:
      * Proprietary DDD extensions without supplying source code, and
      * Incorporating DDD code in proprietary applications
      See the `COPYING.LIB' file for details.


DDD 1.3b
--------

    Bug fix release.

    - More minor troubles with GCC 2.7.0 on certain architectures fixed.
    - DDD can now be interrupted using the SIGINT signal.
    - In the breakpoint editor, you can now set multiple breakpoint
      conditions and ignore counts at a time.
    - The DDD WWW page has moved to `http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/'.


DDD 1.3a
--------

    Bug fix release.

    - Minor troubles with GCC 2.7.0 on certain architectures fixed.
    - New help item: DDD WWW Page.


DDD 1.3
-------

    This release compiles using GCC 2.7; some new features have been
    added and several minor bugs fixed.  Some bugs remain; see the
    `BUGS' file for details.

    Changes to DDD 1.2:
    - You can now edit the current source via an external editor.
    - Display placement has been improved; new displays are now
      created in the current visible view, if possible.
    - The current execution position now stays near the middle of the
      visible source code.  Following statements remain visible.
    - Diagnostics of printing commands no longer get lost.
    - Upon fatal errors, DDD tries to resume execution by returning to
      the main event loop.  This leaves you a chance for exiting the
      debugged program properly.
    - New `Help on Debugging' item.
      Written by David A. Lyons (dlyons@apple.com).
    - Colours slightly reworked: text background is a little brighter.
    - A short DDD survey, including lots of screen shots, is included
      in `doc/ddd-paper.ps'.  The paper also highlights some internal
      aspects of DDD.
    - DDD source code has been adapted to the current ANSI/ISO C++
      draft standard.  Any GCC release from 2.3.3 onwards, including
      the recent GCC 2.7.0, should now compile DDD (unjustified
      commpiler warnings in GCC 2.5 or lower, though).
    - DBX support on Solaris improved.
      Thanks to grant@isgtec.com (Grant McDorman)
    - Patches for FreeBSD incorporated.
      Thanks to smcarey@mailbox.syr.edu (Shawn M. Carey).
    - DDD-specific application defaults now override user application
      defaults.  Thanks to ksfdo0@ksepl.shell.nl (Fred Donck).
    - New GNU librx 0.07.2 library included (from libg++-2.7.0),
      should be faster and more reliable.

    Thanks to all who sent in bug reports and suggestions.  DDD now
    runs on every major UNIX flavour (with the exception of OSF/1 -
    any volunteers for that task?).


DDD 1.2
-------

    Again, a bug fix release.  Many minor bugs have been fixed; see
    the `ChangeLog' file for details.

    Changes to DDD 1.1:
    - DDD source code should now be ANSI/ISO C++ conformant - all code
      specific to GCC or libg++ has been adapted.  DDD now also
      compiles using other C++ compilers than GCC (Sun's CC 4.0 works
      fine; AT&T Cfront 3.0 has trouble with some inline functions).
    - DDD should now run correctly on SGI/IRIX machines.
    - Interrupting processes via the Interrupt button now works
      correctly on Solaris, HP-UX, and other systems.
    - Improved support for GDB artificial arrays.
    - The GDB command window has improved control character support.
      Tabs, Carriage returns, Backspaces and so on are processed
      correctly.  Unprintable characters are also handled.
    - There is an option to suppress X warnings.  This may be useful
      for people annoyed by tons of Motif Keysym warnings.
    - We have started to compile a FAQ list to reduce our daily mail
      load.  See the file `FAQ' for details.

    Thanks to all who sent in bug reports and suggestions.

    As building DDD is still a major challenge for some users, we
    encourage everyone to share her/his binaries with others.  See the
    file ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de:/pub/local/softech/ddd/bin/README for
    details.


DDD 1.1
-------

    Never trust a ``dot-oh'' release - DDD 1.0 had a serious bug that
    caused DDD to crash upon various occasions, often after a few
    interactions.

    Under certain circumstances and on many architectures, the
    hourglass cursor routines could corrupt the stack at a random
    point and thus throw a time bomb into DDD, making DDD fail at
    unpredictable (and unrepeatable) places.  This bug has been fixed;
    some other minor bugs were fixed, too.  See the `ChangeLog' file
    for details.

    Changes to DDD 1.0:
    - C++ References and VTables are fully supported.
    - The source popup menu no longer changes the source selection.


DDD 1.0a
--------

    Bug fix release.

    On many architectures, this DDD release should be much more
    robust.  For unknown reasons, DDD 1.0 choked soon after destroying
    some of its widgets - a bug that must have been introduced at the
    very end of the beta test phase and thus have gone by unnoticed.
    This bug, and some other minor bugs, have been fixed.



DDD 1.0
-------

    First public DDD release.  Many thanks to all who spent their time
    in testing DDD, sending bug reports and suggestions, and making
    DDD what it is today.
    
    This DDD release should configure, compile and run out-of-the-box
    on the following systems:
    
        hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.05
        linux-i386-unknown
        linux-i486-unknown
        mips-dec-ultrix4
        powerpc-ibm-aix3
        rs6000-ibm-aix3
        sparc-sun-sunos4
        sparc-sun-solaris2
    
    If your system is in the list above, please let us know if you
    encountered any problems (unless these are known problems listed
    in the `BUGS' and `PROBLEMS' files).  If your system is not in the
    list above, please let us share your experiences.

    Changes to DDD 0.9:
    - Several last-minute bugs have been fixed.
    - New `Program' menu, introduces keyboard accelerators for frequently
      used commands.
    - Graph printing reworked; you can now set paper size and graph
      orientation.  The bounding box is computed correctly for all sizes.
    - The `Graph' menu has been dropped; its items have been moved 
      into the `Data' and `File' menus.
    - Selecting and moving multiple displays made easier.
    - Pointers to functions are now displayed correctly.
    - Regex name conflicts on Linux fixed.

    Announce policy for future releases:
    - Bug fix releases shall be named 1.0a, 1.0b, and so on.
      In general, they will be announced in DDD mailing lists only.
    - Feature releases shall be numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and so on.
      They will be announced in USENET news as well.
