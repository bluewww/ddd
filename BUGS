# The DDD bug list.

Note: For problems occurring when *building* DDD, see the file `PROBLEMS'.

This is a list of known DDD bugs, which should be fixed in some future
DDD release.  If you want to fix one or more of these bugs, please ask
us (at ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether there are already people working
on that bug.  Similar, if you find a bug, be sure to report it to us
(at ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) such that we may fix it (or include it
in this list :-)

Projects marked with an `*' are to be fixed in the next DDD release.
Volunteers for fixing these and other bugs are welcome!

001. It's too big and too slow.  [This one will never get fixed]

003. Using Motif 1.1 or earlier, the command window is scrolled
     whenever obscured.  [This seems to be a Motif bug.]

013. Raising windows using the `Views' menu does not assign them `mwm'
     input focus.  [Anyone willing to give me a hint here?  -AZ]

015. On Motif 1.2 or later, using DDD with both explicit keyboard
     focus and a panned graph editor causes problems: Keyboard
     traversal of the graph editor does not work; on
     mips-dec-ultrix4.4 (and others?), pointer selection of an
     arbitrary display causes DDD to crash.  [It seems that it is
     generally not wise to combine explicit keyboard focus and panned
     data displays, since this means involving Athena widgets in Motif
     keyboard traversal.  A simple workaround: If you want panners,
     don't use explicit keyboard focus; if you want explicit keyboard
     focus, use scrollbars.]

021. Using Sun DBX, attempting to dereference a `(nil)' pointer
     results in an error message and no new display.  However, the
     expression is entered as an ordinary display.

026. Using DBX with PASCAL or Modula-2, selected array elements are
     always counted from zero, instead of the starting index of the array.

037. Paul Eggert (eggert@twinsun.com) states:

     The first time I ran ddd, my X server dumped core!  Ack!

     Here are the details.  I was running on `shade', a SunOS 4.1.4
     sparc, using the old X News server.  ddd was running on a Solaris
     2.4 host, with the DISPLAY='shade:0'.

     I managed to narrow it down to the following.  Use the .Xdefaults
     at the end of this message.  This should be the only file in your
     home directory.  Log in to a SunOS 4.1.x (x = 3 or 4) host ONE.
     Type `/usr/openwin/bin/openwin' to start up Open Windows.  Click
     in the command tool, and type `rlogin TWO' where TWO is a Solaris
     2.4 host.  Then type `setenv DISPLAY ONE:0' (where ONE is the
     SunOS 4.1.x host).  Then run `ddd'.  This will make the SunOS
     4.1.x X server dump core.  [I could not reproduce this.  Anyone
     willing to give me a hint here?  -AZ]

040. dmitzel@everest.hitc.com (Danny J. Mitzel) states:
     I'm running the DDD 1.1 sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1 prebuilt binary on a
     Sun4/300 SunOS4.1.3_U1.  I notice that once I have typed any
     commands in the 'DDD Command Window' and then bring up the
     'Command History' list that there is always an extra entry at the
     bottom of the list, usually it's blank sometimes there's garbage.
     anyways, selecting that entry leads to 'Internal error
     (Segmentation fault).'  no core dump.  I've attached the
     '--configuration' and '--check-configuration' report.  let me
     know if you need any other info.
     [A bug in Motif 1.1 - does not occur in later Motif versions].

041. Starting a multi-window DDD iconified under vtwm and fvwm causes
     trouble with group iconification.

043. vickery@babbage.cs.qc.edu (Christopher Vickery) states: The
     display() operation generates a segmentation fault if the
     variable to be displayed is an uninitialized pointer.  [I could
     not reproduce this bug.  Can anyone clarify this?  -AZ]

049. The bounding box is computed for all boxes, even if only selected
     boxes are to be printed.

050. jcrupi@mystech.com (John Crupi) states: When trying to
     dereference (using the mouse) a very large structure, ddd locks
     up.  It usually happens if I quickly select 'dereference' after I
     display the pointer.  The structure contains unions.  Machine is
     sparc-sun-solaris2.4.  [I could not reproduce this bug.  Can
     anyone clarify this?  -AZ]

051. grant@isgtec.com (Grant McDorman) has run purify on DDD 1.2 and
     reported some memory leaks as well as bad memory accesses.
     [Could someone do this for a recent DDD release?  -AZ]

056. `Select All' does not select hints.

060. Frank Dohrmann <frank@kaa.desy.de> says that on his Sun-Sparc
     10/41 with SunOS 4.1.3, using `lpr' instead of `lp -c' to print
     the graph hangs up DDD.
     [I could not reproduce this bug.  Can anyone clarify this?  -AZ]

062. Seth J. Bradley <sbradley@scic.intel.com> says that DDD only
     displays the upper 32 bits of "unsigned long long" data.
     Xxgdb, mxgdb and xde all display the full 64 bits of this data
     type.
     [I could not reproduce this bug.  Can anyone clarify this?  -AZ]

077. oyvind@stavanger.Geco-Prakla.slb.com (Oyvind Yrke) says that DDD 2.0
     crashes after receiving too much data from GDB (e.g. `info
     functions').
     [Does this still happen in DDD 2.1?  -AZ]

079. Window resize problems.  louie@dbmx.com (Lewis Alderton) says: I
     am running using FVWM (virtual window manager) and when the
     breakpoints and stack-frame windows pop up, they appear as the
     width of the virtual screen, which is twice as wide as the actual
     screen.

     With the stackframe window I can resize the frame and it is OK,
     but with the breakpoints window, resize causes the window to
     redraw is such a manner as to hide all the breakpoints, once this
     has happened, I can never see breakpoints in this window again.

     [I could not reproduce this bug.  Can anyone clarify this?  -AZ]

085. Lassi A. Tuura <Lassi.Tuura@cern.ch> states:

     - There is a bug somewhere in graph layout code that manifests
       only on highest KCC optimization levels (+K2 and +K3).  The
       result is that if I dereference any pointer, the following
       happens:
         - the arrow is drawn to extreme left, beyond the left edge
         - the panner window becomes very wide and the current view
           is just a thin line in the panner
         - moving the panner handle has no effect -- no scrolling is
           ever done; thus I cannot make the target of the pointer
           visible
       This is very repeatable, as it happens every time.  DDD does
       not crash, however.  My first guess is that somehow something
       goes either negative or to extremely large positive value.  I
       could try to narrow down the location of the bug if someone
       would be nice enough to tell me which functions to look at.
     [This is a bug in KCC.  Don't know how to fix this  -AZ]

086. mayer@paradigml.com (Ron Mayer) says:

     In a number of structures I would attempt to "Modify [the]
     dependent display expression" to display in hex using expressions
     like "/x g->head", instead of the default "(g)->head".

     Occasionally this would make ddd hang, and lock up the X-server
     completely so that I would have to rlogin from another terminal
     to kill the program.  The bus-error was not reproducable, and
     unfortunatelly I had core files disabled when it happened.

     These structures did happen to be in a mmap()'d region of shared
     memory, but since I didn't see the problems when I didn't use the
     "/x" modifier I suspect this isn't the problem.

     PS: What is the prefered way (if any) of making the hex output 
         the default in the display graph?  If I "set output-radix 16" 
         in the gdb window ddd seems to lock up very often.
     [I could not reproduce this bug.  Can anyone clarify this?  -AZ]

107. Jonathan Edwards <edwards@blight.IntraNet.com> says that DDD/DBX
     hangs up on his powerpc-ibm-aix4.2.0.0 box after a few `step's.
     [I could not reproduce this bug on a rs6000-ibm-aix4.1.4.0.
      Does this also happen on other configurations?  -AZ]

108. Satish Chandra <am939@gobhp1.fs.cummins.com> says that on his
     alpha-dec-osf3.2, sometimes ddd/gdb seems to hang for no
     apprarent reason and needs to be killed.
     [Anyone willing to give me a hint here?  -AZ]

109. Satish Chandra <am939@gobhp1.fs.cummins.com> says
     (alpha-dec-osf3.2, make check): After setting up several
     breakpoints, I clicked on Run.  The debugger stopped at the first
     breakpoint; however the arrow didn't show up.  Upon continuation,
     the arrow showed up.  Minor cosmetic bug.
     [I cannot reproduce this.  Can anyone comment?  -AZ]

113. Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> states:
     If I resize the data display the background doesn't get
     refreshed.  [Use an Athena Panner instead of Motif scrollbars  -AZ]

117. Under Linux slackware 3.1, the file permissions in `/dev/ptyp?'
     do not allow for DDD <-> GDB interaction.  [Can we circumvent
     this within DDD?  -AZ]

118. SGI CC compiles DDD, but the resulting executable soon dies with a
     segmentation fault.  [Use GCC instead.  -AZ]

122. Torsten Metzner <tom@plato.uni-paderborn.de> says: On
     my sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1, have DDD run with `--exec-window' in
     the background.  Starting the execution TTY causes DDD to stop
     with `Suspended (tty output)'.

123. David Bianchi <bianchi@pllb.inet.it> states: Using DDD 2.0 on
     hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.07, a SIGSEGV appears whenever we choose the
     menu item "Open Program..." as well as "Open Core Dump..." from
     the menu bar.  [Motif bug?  HP-UX bug?  Obviously, this should
     not happen.  But I doubt that the problem is within DDD.  -AZ]

126. Flashing data window.  Thomas Liefke
     <liefke@cdc.Informatik.TH-Darmstadt.DE> says: 

     The data window is flashing forever in certain circumstances. The
     flashing looks like a rapid, endless update of the data
     displayed. The flashing only occurs when the panner is
     used. While the window (i.e. the boxes and the panner) is
     flashing, another panner is occurring in the upper left corner in
     each flash-cycle.

     The flashing does NOT occur when the scroll bar is used instead of a
     panner.

     How I can reproduce the bug:

     ddd ctest

     now I press:

     break at()
     run
     step
     click on variable 'tree' and select 'display'
     click on box 'tree' and select 'display*'
     click on 'data = {...}' and select 'show detail'

     make the data window smaller so that the lower box doesn't fit
     completely into window

     make the data window big enough for all three boxes.

     Then the window is flashing forever unless I make the window
     smaller and then bigger again.

     When I repeatedly change the size, the flashing comes again but
     not each time the window size is big enough to hold all boxes.
     [I could not reproduce this problem.  -AZ]

     This flashing occurs in the vsl demos as well.

     For example:

     cd ddd-2.0/vsllib
     ../ddd/vsl DEMOS/arcs

     Now the window is flashing until I increase the size of the
     window so that everything fits into it. The flashing doesn't
     occur again when I decrease the window size to the original size.

     The flashing occurs in other demos as well. It doesn't occur in
     DEMOS/bigflow.

     I experienced the flashing neither in version 1.4 nor in version
     2.0beta.
     [This one is easily reproducible, but has low priority.  -AZ]

127. Bob Vickers <bobv@dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk> says that DDD 2.0
     (alpha-dec-osf3.2) sometimes fails to start.  Often it works
     fine. But sometimes, especially if you haven't run it for a while
     (e.g. first thing in the morning) the command window comes up but
     there is no sign of the source window. There are sometimes error
     messages, and these vary slightly.

     The parent Unix window sometimes contains tty error messages, e.g.

     platon$ make check
     ==> Making check in ./ddd...
     make[1]: Entering directory `/nobackup/work/bobv/ddd-2.0/ddd'
     XUSERFILESEARCHPATH=. XAPPLRESDIR=. ./ddd cxxtest
     X Toolkit Warning: Cannot convert string 
     "-*-Menu-Medium-R-Normal--*-120-*-*-P-*-ISO8859-1" to type FontStruct
     (gdb) cannot set terminal foreground process group: I/O error
     (gdb) cannot get slave terminal settings: I/O error

     [We cannot fix this, as we neither have an OSF box nor
      appropriate OSF documentation at our disposition.  The DDD
      distribution comes with a demo program `ttytest' which is useful
      for debugging the TTY interface in `TTYAgent.C'  -AZ]

131. `Find<<' and `Find>>' should be in the `Edit' menu (at least for
     sources)

139. With Solaris 2.5.1, DDD recurses endlessly in glob_filename().
     Reported by Deepak Mulchandani <dmm@jurassic.eng.sun.com>
     [Can anyone reproduce this?  -AZ]

150. In GDB Modula-2-mode, DDD displays are named `^tree' instead of
     `tree^'.  [This is a GDB bug.  Here's a patch for GDB 4.16:

152. Curved edges cannot (yet) be printed.

153. Jonathan Edwards <edwards@intranet.com> says that in AIX DBX,
     the local variable display does not display function arguments.
     [May this be due to using AIX xlC instead of GCC?  -AZ]

155. DBX `dump` output is not understood if local arrays are shown.
     (DBX prints these as `ARRAY')

159. Jonathan Edwards <edwards@intranet.com> says:
     A status display only shows once.  After stepping the program it
     collapses into just the title.  Doing a refresh command restores
     the display.
     [This is due to using AIX xlC instead of GCC.  -AZ]

168. Jens Albrecht <Jens.Albrecht@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
     complains that using DBX, the `file' command does not change the
     source file.

169. The Manual Browser does not recognize manual (sub-)titles for
     ULTRIX and HP-UX `man' formats (probably problems with others,
     too)

172. Jonathan Edwards <edwards@intranet.com> says: If I interrupt my
     program while it is running, my data displays are not updated,
     and instead I get the info in the debugger console.

173. Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> says:
     - Often the first graph display is not completely inside the
       window; after selecting 'layout graph' things are right
     [I could not reproduce this. -AZ]

174. Command tool placement problems.  Graham Gough
     <graham@cs.man.ac.uk> states: I'm running fvwm2 with a 2x2
     virtual screen arrangement. If I start DDD 2.1 in the top left
     screen, the command pad always appears in the bottom left screen
     (in the top right corner). DDD 2.0 doesn't give this behaviour:
     the command pad pops up in the screen on which I start it.
     [I could not reproduce this. -AZ]

175. Harry Mangalam <mangalam@uci.edu> reports: As soon as I click on
     a variable to try to highlight a structure name, DDD 2.1 goes
     into an unresponsive state for several seconds (seems like up to
     a minute on a 486) in which the ddd process hogs the cpu.  It
     then returns to a usable state until the next time I try to
     highlight a variable name.  It seems that if I click on a simple
     variable name, it responds appopriately, but if I try to
     drag-hilite the name, ddd goes berserk with the cpu.
     [I could not reproduce this. -AZ]

177. Michael Taeschner <Michael.Taeschner@dlr.de> reports that using
     SGI dbx, setting of temporary breakpoints regularly fails because
     dbx cannot handle `when at { }' without a command inside the
     parentheses (this should be `{ delete xx,yy }' anyway).

196. DDD started with the XDB debugger gets a segmentation fault during
     startup.  This happens when XDB issues the following line:

     <- "\r\e[K\e[7mStandard input: END\e[m"

     [Is this still true for DDD 2.2?  -AZ]

198. In `--tty' mode, EOF terminates DDD, even if only a subprogram
     (e.g. a shell) is running.

200. With DBX on SunOS 4.1.4, sessions do not work (cannot save core
     file).

202. Hal Manuel <hemanuel@gar.esys.com> states that he gets a command
     tool no matter what preference he has saved.

203. On IRIX6.3 and DBX, the green arrow indicating the current
     execution position is always at the first line of the currently
     active source file.  Reported by Uwe Wark <uw@bruker.de>

204. Switching from glyphs to text loses the current PC.

206. (Insert your bug here)
