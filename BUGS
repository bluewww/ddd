# The DDD bug list.

Note: For problems occurring when *building* DDD, see the file `PROBLEMS'.

This is a list of known DDD bugs, which should be fixed in some future
DDD release.  If you want to fix one or more of these bugs, please ask
us (at ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether there are already people working
on that bug.  Similar, if you find a bug, be sure to report it to us
(at ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) such that we may fix it (or include it
in this list :-)

Bugs marked with an `*' represent work in progress.
Volunteers for fixing these and other bugs are welcome!

001. It's too big and too slow.  [This one will never get fixed]

002. [fixed]

003. Using Motif 1.1 or earlier, the command window is scrolled
     whenever obscured.  [This seems to be a Motif bug.]

010. On some systems, switching back from running processes in the
     execution window to running processes in the command window does
     not work correctly; processes attempting to read from stdio are
     interrupted with SIGTTIN.  [This is due to the `tty' command in
     GDB, which on some systems messes up tty control when applied to
     the command window pty.  As a workaround, enter a line
     `*useTTYCommand: false' in `~/.dddinit': this will set up an
     alternative redirection scheme].

011. [fixed]

012. [fixed]

013. Raising windows using the `Windows' menu does not assign them `mwm'
     input focus.  [Anyone willing to give me a hint here?  -AZ]

014. [fixed]

015. On Motif 1.2 or later, using DDD with both explicit keyboard
     focus and a panned graph editor causes problems: Keyboard
     traversal of the graph editor does not work; on
     mips-dec-ultrix4.4 (and others?), pointer selection of an
     arbitrary display causes DDD to crash.  [It seems that it is
     generally not wise to combine explicit keyboard focus and panned
     data displays, since this means involving Athena widgets in Motif
     keyboard traversal.  A simple workaround: If you want panners,
     don't use explicit keyboard focus; if you want explicit keyboard
     focus, use scrollbars.]

017. [fixed]

018. [not a DDD bug, forwarded to manual page]

019. [not a DDD bug, forwarded to manual page]

020. [fixed]

021. Using DBX, attempting to dereference a `(nil)' pointer results in
     an error message and no new display.  However, the expression is
     entered as an ordinary display.

022. [fixed]

023. [fixed]

024. [fixed]

025. DBX on mips-dec-ultrix4 is only partially supported since it has
     an entirely different output format than Sun's DBX.  [If someone
     convinces us that s/he requires ULTRIX DBX support, we'll do it.]

026. Using DBX with PASCAL or Modula-2, selected array elements are
     always counted from zero, instead of the starting index of the array.

037. Paul Eggert (eggert@twinsun.com) states:

     The first time I ran ddd, my X server dumped core!  Ack!

     Here are the details.  I was running on `shade', a SunOS 4.1.4
     sparc, using the old X News server.  ddd was running on a Solaris
     2.4 host, with the DISPLAY='shade:0'.

     I managed to narrow it down to the following.  Use the .Xdefaults
     at the end of this message.  This should be the only file in your
     home directory.  Log in to a SunOS 4.1.x (x = 3 or 4) host ONE.
     Type `/usr/openwin/bin/openwin' to start up Open Windows.  Click
     in the command tool, and type `rlogin TWO' where TWO is a Solaris
     2.4 host.  Then type `setenv DISPLAY ONE:0' (where ONE is the
     SunOS 4.1.x host).  Then run `ddd'.  This will make the SunOS
     4.1.x X server dump core.

038. Doing `Open Source' and typing in the name of an
     executable causes DDD to abort with 

     SourceView.C: In function `static char *
     SourceView::read_indented(class string &)':

     SourceView.C:728: assertion `pos_ptr - indented_text ==
     indented_text_length' failed

     Reported by neal@ctd.comsat.com (Neal Becker).

039. [fixed]

040. dmitzel@everest.hitc.com (Danny J. Mitzel) states:
     I'm running the DDD 1.1 sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1 prebuilt binary on a
     Sun4/300 SunOS4.1.3_U1.  I notice that once I have typed any
     commands in the 'DDD Command Window' and then bring up the
     'Command History' list that there is always an extra entry at the
     bottom of the list, usually it's blank sometimes there's garbage.
     anyways, selecting that entry leads to 'Internal error
     (Segmentation fault).'  no core dump.  I've attached the
     '--configuration' and '--check-configuration' report.  let me
     know if you need any other info.
     [A bug in Motif 1.1 - does not occur in later Motif versions].

041. Starting DDD iconified under vtwm causes trouble with group
     iconification.

042. [fixed]

043. vickery@babbage.cs.qc.edu (Christopher Vickery) states:
     The display() operation generates a segmentation fault if the variable
     to be displayed is an uninitialized pointer.

044. DDD does not run on a DEC Alpha running OSF/1.  As
     bjtong@cse.unsw.edu.au (Banchong Harangsri) states, when coming
     to starting it up, DDD just hung over, i.e., it didn't accept any
     of the keyboard or mouse that the user types in.  Also, there
     were lots of warnings in the rx library.
     hannu@roope.cctap.carel.fi (Hannu Mallat) states that DDD usually
     kept crashing right in the start or a bit later.

045. The distributed DDD binary for Linux crashes on some machines as
     soon as `Open Source' is selected.  This has also been reported
     from freebsd2.0 users.  [According to dernst@pppl.gov (Darin
     Ernst), this is a bug in the Motif libraries, not in DDD: ``any
     call to OpenFileSelectionDialog() will give a seg fault when
     using motif 2.0 and gcc 2.6.3, regardless of kernel version'';
     raines@slac.stanford.edu (Paul Raines) states that ``from what I
     recall of the motif newsgroup discussion, it is totally Motif's
     fault''].  We now have a Linux DDD binary linked with a fixed
     SWiM Motif 2.0 library available.  As a workaround, use the GDB
     `file' and `core' commands; to open a specific source, use the
     GDB `info file FUNCTION' command, where FUNCTION is a function
     defined in that source file.

046. Line continuations (i.e. GDB commands ended by `\' and continued
     on the next line) are not handled.

047. [fixed]

048. [fixed]

049. The bounding box is computed for all boxes, even if only selected
     boxes are to be printed.

050. jcrupi@mystech.com (John Crupi) states: 
     When trying to dereference (using the mouse) a very large
     structure, ddd locks up.  It usually happens if I quickly select
     'dereference' after I display the pointer.  The structure contains
     unions.  Machine is sparc-sun-solaris2.4.

051. grant@isgtec.com (Grant McDorman) has run purify on DDD and
     reported some memory leaks as well as bad memory accesses.

052. [fixed]

053. emeijer@us.oracle.com (Edwin Meijer) states:
     I tried the following scenario: 
     > exec program [arg,....] 
     and while my program was in a sleep I did:  
     > ddd --dbx program process-id 
     ddd seemed to start up fine, but after loading it core-dumped. 

054. [fixed]

055. [fixed]

056. `Select All' does not select hints.

057. Mike Hoffmann <mike@psa.pencom.com> states: 
     I had been successfuly using DDD 1.2 on Solaris 2.4 w/ X11R6 fix
     level 11.  Since then I updated to the latest fix level 12, that
     came out a few weeks ago.  Now DDD hangs at "random" points when
     coming up.

058. Anonymous unions as struct members are not handled correctly.
     Check bit fields as well.

059. Having a newline ``stuck'' in the command line makes DDD execute
     each typed letter as a separate command.

060. Frank Dohrmann <frank@kaa.desy.de> says that on his Sun-Sparc
     10/41 with SunOs 4.1.3, using `lpr' instead of `lp -c' to print
     the graph hangs up DDD.

061. (Insert your bug here)
