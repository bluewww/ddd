# The list of known DDD bugs.

Note: For problems occurring when *building* DDD, see the file `PROBLEMS'.
      For reported bugs that could not yet be reproduced, see `OPENBUGS'.

This is a list of known (i.e. reproducible) DDD bugs, which should be
fixed in some future DDD release.  If you want to fix one or more of
these bugs, please ask us (at ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether there are
already people working on that bug.  Similar, if you find a bug, be
sure to report it to us (at ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) such that we may
fix it (or include it in this list :-)

Projects marked with an `*' are to be fixed in the next DDD release.
Volunteers for fixing these and other bugs are welcome!

001 It's too big and too slow.  [This one will never get fixed]

003 (Motif 1.1) The command window is scrolled whenever obscured.

021 (DBX) Using Sun DBX, attempting to dereference a `(nil)' pointer
    results in an error message and no new display.  However, the
    expression is entered as an ordinary display.

026 (DBX) Using Sun DBX with PASCAL or Modula-2, selected array
    elements are not counted from the starting index of the array.

041 Starting a multi-window DDD iconified under vtwm and fvwm causes
    trouble with group iconification.

049 The bounding box is computed for all boxes, even if only selected
    boxes are to be printed.

126 Flashing data window.  Thomas Liefke
    <liefke@cdc.Informatik.TH-Darmstadt.DE> reports that the data
    window is flashing forever in certain circumstances. The flashing
    looks like a rapid, endless update of the data displayed. The
    flashing only occurs when the panner is used.  While the window
    (i.e. the boxes and the panner) is flashing, another panner is
    occurring in the upper left corner in each flash-cycle.

    The flashing does NOT occur when the scroll bar is used instead of a
    panner.

    How I can reproduce the bug:

    ddd ctest

    now I press:

    break at()
    run
    step
    click on variable 'tree' and select 'display'
    click on box 'tree' and select 'display*'
    click on 'data = {...}' and select 'show detail'

    make the data window smaller so that the lower box doesn't fit
    completely into window

    make the data window big enough for all three boxes.

    Then the window is flashing forever unless I make the window
    smaller and then bigger again.

    When I repeatedly change the size, the flashing comes again but
    not each time the window size is big enough to hold all boxes.

152 Curved edges cannot (yet) be printed.
    [Any PostScript and FIG gurus out there?  -AZ]

155 (DBX) `dump` output is not understood if local arrays are shown.
    (DBX prints these as `ARRAY')

169 The Manual Browser does not recognize manual (sub-)titles for
    ULTRIX and HP-UX `man' formats (probably problems with others, too)

249 Zdenek Sekera <zs@cray.com> reports:
 
    c. Some Makefiles in the subdirectories do not use CFLAGS thus
       making it neccessary to always edit them to put in the correct
       options.  This is very time consuming in particular on
       (e.g. myself) always forgets at least some little wee thing
       somewhere....
       [This is a problem of the libiberty and librx maintainers.  -AZ]
 
    d. In the same veine, when I run e.g. "configure --prefix='$(HOME)'",
       the $(HOME) does not get propagated to all Makefiles.
       [This is a problem of the libiberty and librx maintainers.  -AZ]

255 In Java programs, the `info set' status display is treated as
    variable list.

272 (LessTif) The `select' font selection method works only once.

281 In auto deiconify mode, the Debugger Console uniconifies even if
    other DDD windows are already there.

286 (Motif) Changing Cut/Copy/Paste accelerators at runtime does not work.

290 (Motif 1.1) The `Settings' dialog is too wide.

297 Using display commands like `undisplay' directly instead of using
    the `graph' prefix confuses DDD - displays are considered
    `inactive'.
