# The DDD bug list.

Note: For problems occurring when *building* DDD, see the file `PROBLEMS'.

This is a list of known DDD bugs, which should be fixed in some future
DDD release.  If you want to fix one or more of these bugs, please ask
us (at ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether there are already people working
on that bug.  Similar, if you find a bug, be sure to report it to us
(at ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) such that we may fix it (or include it
in this list :-)

Bugs marked with an `*' represent work in progress.
Volunteers for fixing these and other bugs are welcome!

001. It's too big and too slow.  [This one will never get fixed]

002. [fixed]

003. Using Motif 1.1 or earlier, the command window is scrolled
     whenever obscured.  [This seems to be a Motif bug.]

004. [fixed]

005. [fixed]

006. [fixed]

007. [fixed]

008. [fixed]

009. [fixed]

010. On some systems, switching back from running processes in the
     execution window to running processes in the command window does
     not work correctly; processes attempting to read from stdio are
     interrupted with SIGTTIN.  [This is due to the `tty' command in
     GDB, which on some systems messes up tty control when applied to
     the command window pty.  As a workaround, enter a line
     `*useTTYCommand: false' in `~/.dddinit': this will set up an
     alternative redirection scheme].

011. [fixed]

012. [fixed]

013. Raising windows using the `Windows' menu does not assign them `mwm'
     input focus.  [Anyone willing to give me a hint here?  -AZ]

014. [fixed]

015. On Motif 1.2 or later, using DDD with both explicit keyboard
     focus and a panned graph editor causes problems: Keyboard
     traversal of the graph editor does not work; on
     mips-dec-ultrix4.4 (and others?), pointer selection of an
     arbitrary display causes DDD to crash.  [It seems that it is
     generally not wise to combine explicit keyboard focus and panned
     data displays, since this means involving Athena widgets in Motif
     keyboard traversal.  A simple workaround: If you want panners,
     don't use explicit keyboard focus; if you want explicit keyboard
     focus, use scrollbars.]

016. [fixed]

017. On Solaris, exiting DDD while the debugger is still running
     sometimes results in a core dump.
     [May be fixed in DDD 1.0a and later.]

018. [not a DDD bug, forwarded to manual page]

019. [not a DDD bug, forwarded to manual page]

020. [fixed]

021. Using DBX, attempting to dereference a `(nil)' pointer results in
     an error message and no new display.  However, the expression is
     entered as an ordinary display.

022. Doug.Royer@eng.sun.com (Doug Royer [KD6HBW]) states:
     > On Solaris 2.5, when I run it, I get:
     > Warning: Actions not found: select-start, extend-end, doTheRightThing
     > Warning: Actions not found: select-start, extend-end, doTheRightThing
     > Warning: Actions not found: select-start, extend-end, doTheRightThing
     > (gdb)  write failed: Resource temporarily unavailable
     > ddd hangs.
     [We cannot determine what causes this error.  On Solaris 2.4, DDD
      runs fine.]
     [May be fixed in DDD 1.0a and later.]

023. Doug.Royer@eng.sun.com (Doug Royer [KD6HBW]) states:
     > On Solaris 2.5, when I try to 'file->open file...', I get not errors,
     > and nothing happens.
     [May be related with 022, above; `Open file' tries to get the
      current directory from GDB and this won't work if GDB hangs.]
     [May be fixed in DDD 1.0a and later.]

024. On mips-sgi-irix5.2, DDD issues a message `(gdb) write failed:
     Bad file number' and hangs.  Reported by ckumarad@oci.utoronto.ca
     (Carl Kumaradas) and baird@asc.on.ca (Warren Baird).  [Anyone
     willing to fix this? The pty is created in `TTYAgent.C', using
     the SGI _getpty() function; the master side is accessed in
     `LiterateA.C'.]

025. DBX on mips-dec-ultrix4 is only partially supported since it has
     an entirely different output format than Sun's DBX.  [If someone
     convinces us that s/he requires ULTRIX DBX support, we'll do it.]

026. Using DBX with PASCAL or Modula-2, selected array elements are
     always counted from zero, instead of the starting index of the array.

027. [fixed]

028. The `-iconic' option does not work.

029. Displays created by `graph display "abc"' are not parsed
     correctly.

030. [fixed]

031. On Solaris 2.3, DDD dumps core when dereferencing `date_ptrs' in
     the `cxxtest' program.  Reported by
     Herve.Poirier@grenoble.rxrc.xerox.com (Herve Poirier) and
     dana@bellcore.com (Dana A Chee).  [Should be fixed in DDD 1.0a
     and later.]

032. [fixed]

033. Tab characters are not supported in argument field.  Go and
     convert'em; just like '\n's.

034. '\r' output is not supported in command window.

035. On LINUX, ddd fails when opening a file selection box.  Reported
     by mende@ips.cs.tu-bs.de (Andreas Mende).  [Be sure not to use
     librx/librx.a when it is already part of the OS standard library,
     as on LINUX].

036. Indexes in artificial arrays are not properly generated.
     Also, artificial arrays should be mentioned in the man page.

037. Paul Eggert (eggert@twinsun.com) states:

     The first time I ran ddd, my X server dumped core!  Ack!

     Here are the details.  I was running on `shade', a SunOS 4.1.4
     sparc, using the old X News server.  ddd was running on a Solaris
     2.4 host, with the DISPLAY='shade:0'.

     I managed to narrow it down to the following.  Use the .Xdefaults
     at the end of this message.  This should be the only file in your
     home directory.  Log in to a SunOS 4.1.x (x = 3 or 4) host ONE.
     Type `/usr/openwin/bin/openwin' to start up Open Windows.  Click
     in the command tool, and type `rlogin TWO' where TWO is a Solaris
     2.4 host.  Then type `setenv DISPLAY ONE:0' (where ONE is the
     SunOS 4.1.x host).  Then run `ddd'.  This will make the SunOS
     4.1.x X server dump core.

038. Doing `Open Source' and typing in the name of an
     executable causes DDD to abort with 

     SourceView.C: In function `static char *
     SourceView::read_indented(class string &)':

     SourceView.C:728: assertion `pos_ptr - indented_text ==
     indented_text_length' failed

     Reported by neal@ctd.comsat.com (Neal Becker).

039. [done]

040. dmitzel@everest.hitc.com (Danny J. Mitzel) states:

     I'm running the DDD 1.1 sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1 prebuilt binary on a
     Sun4/300 SunOS4.1.3_U1.  I notice that once I have typed any
     commands in the 'DDD Command Window' and then bring up the
     'Command History' list that there is always an extra entry at the
     bottom of the list, usually it's blank sometimes there's garbage.
     anyways, selecting that entry leads to 'Internal error
     (Segmentation fault).'  no core dump.  I've attached the
     '--configuration' and '--check-configuration' report.  let me
     know if you need any other info.

041. (Insert your bug here)
