# The DDD bug list.

Note: For problems occurring when *building* DDD, see the file `PROBLEMS'.

This is a list of known DDD bugs, which should be fixed in some future
DDD release.  If you want to fix one or more of these bugs, please ask
us (at ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether there are already people working
on that bug.  Similar, if you find a bug, be sure to report it to us
(at ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) such that we may fix it (or include it
in this list :-)

Bugs marked with an `*' represent work in progress.
Volunteers for fixing these and other bugs are welcome!

001. It's too big and too slow.  [This one will never get fixed]

002. [fixed]

003. Using Motif 1.1 or earlier, the command window is scrolled
     whenever obscured.  [This seems to be a Motif bug.]

004. [fixed]

005. [fixed]

006. [fixed]

007. [fixed]

008. [fixed]

009. [fixed]

010. On some systems, switching back from running processes in the
     execution window to running processes in the command window does
     not work correctly; processes attempting to read from stdio are
     interrupted with SIGTTIN.  [This is due to the `tty' command in
     GDB, which on some systems messes up tty control when applied to
     the command window pty.  As a workaround, enter a line
     `*useTTYCommand: false' in `~/.dddinit': this will set up an
     alternative redirection scheme].

011. [fixed]

012. [fixed]

013. Raising windows using the `Windows' menu does not assign them `mwm'
     input focus.  [Anyone willing to give me a hint here?  -AZ]

014. [fixed]

015. On Motif 1.2 or later, using DDD with both explicit keyboard
     focus and a panned graph editor causes problems: Keyboard
     traversal of the graph editor does not work; on
     mips-dec-ultrix4.4 (and others?), pointer selection of an
     arbitrary display causes DDD to crash.  [It seems that it is
     generally not wise to combine explicit keyboard focus and panned
     data displays, since this means involving Athena widgets in Motif
     keyboard traversal.  A simple workaround: If you want panners,
     don't use explicit keyboard focus; if you want explicit keyboard
     focus, use scrollbars.]

016. [fixed]

017. On Solaris, exiting DDD while the debugger is still running
     sometimes results in a core dump.

018. [not a DDD bug, forwarded to manual page]

019. [not a DDD bug, forwarded to manual page]

020. [fixed]

021. Using DBX, attempting to dereference a `(nil)' pointer results in
     an error message and no new display.  However, the expression is
     entered as an ordinary display.

022. Doug.Royer@eng.sun.com (Doug Royer [KD6HBW]) states:
     > On Solaris 2.5, when I run it, I get:
     > Warning: Actions not found: select-start, extend-end, doTheRightThing
     > Warning: Actions not found: select-start, extend-end, doTheRightThing
     > Warning: Actions not found: select-start, extend-end, doTheRightThing
     > (gdb)  write failed: Resource temporarily unavailable
     > ddd hangs.
     [We cannot determine what causes this error.  On Solaris 2.4, DDD
      runs fine.]

023. Doug.Royer@eng.sun.com (Doug Royer [KD6HBW]) states:
     > On Solaris 2.5, when I try to 'file->open file...', I get not errors,
     > and nothing happens.
     [Maybe related with 022, above; `Open file' tries to get the
      current directory from GDB and this won't work if GDB hangs.]

024. (Insert your bug here)
