# The DDD bug list.

Note: For problems occurring when *building* DDD, see the file `PROBLEMS'.

This is a list of known DDD bugs, which should be fixed in some future
DDD release.  If you want to fix one or more of these bugs, please ask
us (at ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether there are already people working
on that bug.  Similar, if you find a bug, be sure to report it to us
(at ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) such that we may fix it (or include it
in this list :-)

Projects marked with an `*' are to be fixed in the next DDD release.
Volunteers for fixing these and other bugs are welcome!

001 It's too big and too slow.  [This one will never get fixed]

003 Using Motif 1.1 or earlier, the command window is scrolled
    whenever obscured.  [This seems to be a Motif bug.]

013 Raising windows using the `View' menu does not assign them `mwm'
    input focus.  [Anyone willing to give me a hint here?  -AZ]

021 Using Sun DBX, attempting to dereference a `(nil)' pointer
    results in an error message and no new display.  However, the
    expression is entered as an ordinary display.

026 Using DBX with PASCAL or Modula-2, selected array elements are
    always counted from zero, instead of the starting index of the array.

041 Starting a multi-window DDD iconified under vtwm and fvwm causes
    trouble with group iconification.

049 The bounding box is computed for all boxes, even if only selected
    boxes are to be printed.

086 mayer@paradigml.com (Ron Mayer) says:

    In a number of structures I would attempt to "Modify [the]
    dependent display expression" to display in hex using expressions
    like "/x g->head", instead of the default "(g)->head".

    Occasionally this would make ddd hang, and lock up the X-server
    completely so that I would have to rlogin from another terminal
    to kill the program.  The bus-error was not reproducable, and
    unfortunatelly I had core files disabled when it happened.

    These structures did happen to be in a mmap()'d region of shared
    memory, but since I didn't see the problems when I didn't use the
    "/x" modifier I suspect this isn't the problem.

    PS: What is the prefered way (if any) of making the hex output 
        the default in the display graph?  If I "set output-radix 16" 
        in the gdb window ddd seems to lock up very often.
    [I could not reproduce this bug.  Can anyone clarify this?  -AZ]

113 Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> states:
    If I resize the data display the background doesn't get
    refreshed.  [Use an Athena Panner instead of Motif scrollbars. -AZ]

117 Under Linux slackware 3.1, the file permissions in `/dev/ptyp?'
    do not allow for DDD <-> GDB interaction.  [Can we circumvent
    this within DDD?  -AZ]

118 SGI CC compiles DDD, but the resulting executable soon dies with a
    segmentation fault.  [Use GCC instead.  -AZ]

126 Flashing data window.  Thomas Liefke
    <liefke@cdc.Informatik.TH-Darmstadt.DE> says: 

    The data window is flashing forever in certain circumstances. The
    flashing looks like a rapid, endless update of the data
    displayed. The flashing only occurs when the panner is
    used. While the window (i.e. the boxes and the panner) is
    flashing, another panner is occurring in the upper left corner in
    each flash-cycle.

    The flashing does NOT occur when the scroll bar is used instead of a
    panner.

    How I can reproduce the bug:

    ddd ctest

    now I press:

    break at()
    run
    step
    click on variable 'tree' and select 'display'
    click on box 'tree' and select 'display*'
    click on 'data = {...}' and select 'show detail'

    make the data window smaller so that the lower box doesn't fit
    completely into window

    make the data window big enough for all three boxes.

    Then the window is flashing forever unless I make the window
    smaller and then bigger again.

    When I repeatedly change the size, the flashing comes again but
    not each time the window size is big enough to hold all boxes.
    [I could not reproduce this problem.  -AZ]

    This flashing occurs in the vsl demos as well.

    For example:

    cd ddd-2.0/vsllib
    ../ddd/vsl DEMOS/arcs

    Now the window is flashing until I increase the size of the
    window so that everything fits into it. The flashing doesn't
    occur again when I decrease the window size to the original size.

    The flashing occurs in other demos as well. It doesn't occur in
    DEMOS/bigflow.

    I experienced the flashing neither in version 1.4 nor in version
    2.0beta.
    [This one is easily reproducible, but has low priority.  -AZ]

127 Bob Vickers <bobv@dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk> says that DDD 2.0
    (alpha-dec-osf3.2) sometimes fails to start.  Often it works
    fine. But sometimes, especially if you haven't run it for a while
    (e.g. first thing in the morning) the command window comes up but
    there is no sign of the source window. There are sometimes error
    messages, and these vary slightly.

    The parent Unix window sometimes contains tty error messages, e.g.

    platon$ make check
    ==> Making check in ./ddd...
    make[1]: Entering directory `/nobackup/work/bobv/ddd-2.0/ddd'
    XUSERFILESEARCHPATH=. XAPPLRESDIR=. ./ddd cxxtest
    X Toolkit Warning: Cannot convert string 
    "-*-Menu-Medium-R-Normal--*-120-*-*-P-*-ISO8859-1" to type FontStruct
    (gdb) cannot set terminal foreground process group: I/O error
    (gdb) cannot get slave terminal settings: I/O error

    [We cannot fix this, as we neither have an OSF box nor
     appropriate OSF documentation at our disposition.  The DDD
     distribution comes with a demo program `ttytest' which is useful
     for debugging the TTY interface in `TTYAgent.C'  -AZ]

131 `Find<<' and `Find>>' should be in the `Edit' menu (at least for
    sources)

150 In GDB Modula-2-mode, DDD displays are named `^tree' instead of
    `tree^'.  [This is a GDB bug.  Here's a patch for GDB 4.16:

152 Curved edges cannot (yet) be printed.
    [Any PostScript and FIG gurus out there?  -AZ]

153 Jonathan Edwards <edwards@intranet.com> says that in AIX DBX,
    the local variable display does not display function arguments.
    [May this be due to using AIX xlC instead of GCC?  -AZ]

155 DBX `dump` output is not understood if local arrays are shown.
    (DBX prints these as `ARRAY')

159 Jonathan Edwards <edwards@intranet.com> says:
    A status display only shows once.  After stepping the program it
    collapses into just the title.  Doing a refresh command restores
    the display.
    [This is due to using AIX xlC instead of GCC.  -AZ]

168 Jens Albrecht <Jens.Albrecht@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
    complains that using DBX, the `file' command does not change the
    source file.

169 The Manual Browser does not recognize manual (sub-)titles for
    ULTRIX and HP-UX `man' formats (probably problems with others, too)

172 Jonathan Edwards <edwards@intranet.com> says: If I interrupt my
    program while it is running, my data displays are not updated,
    and instead I get the info in the debugger console.

173 Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> says:
    - Often the first graph display is not completely inside the
      window; after selecting 'layout graph' things are right
    [I could not reproduce this. -AZ]

175 Harry Mangalam <mangalam@uci.edu> reports: As soon as I click on
    a variable to try to highlight a structure name, DDD 2.1 goes
    into an unresponsive state for several seconds (seems like up to
    a minute on a 486) in which the ddd process hogs the cpu.  It
    then returns to a usable state until the next time I try to
    highlight a variable name.  It seems that if I click on a simple
    variable name, it responds appopriately, but if I try to
    drag-hilite the name, ddd goes berserk with the cpu.
    [I could not reproduce this. -AZ]

204 Switching from glyphs to text loses the current PC.

215 With separate windows, a newly created assembler window has zero
    height.

222 Bob Vickers <bobv@dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk> reports that the command tool
    sometimes is really big and occupies most of the screen, thus
    obliterating most of the other windows.  This happens with
    OSF/Motif Version 1.2.4 on alpha-dec-osf4.0.

228 Chip Atkinson <chip@XiG.com> and Bernie Borenstein
    <bernieb@deltanet.com> state that after enabling `ungrab mouse
    pointer when interruping modal X application', pressing the right
    mouse button grabs the cursor and won't release.  When ddd is
    killed, the X server cannot give focus to any other windows.
    This happens with Red Hat Linux 4.1 and Metrolink Motif 2.01.

230 Roy Dragseth <royd@math.uit.no> reports that if you type in
    commands really fast in ddd, it gets problems to cope.  When
    using DDD from XEmacs, and defining XEmacs command sequences to
    be sent to DDD, the last command(s) in the sequence get lost.

231 According to Ronald Wahl <Ronald.Wahl@Informatik.TU-Chemnitz.DE>, 
    DDD gets into a busy loop when used with libc-5.4.41 under Linux.

235 Nagi M. Aboulenein <naboulen@ichips.intel.com> says: I'm seeing a
    persistent problem with various version of DDD on FreeBSD/x86
    platforms. The problem occurs when an attempt is made to save
    options. At that point DDD dies and the options file is not
    updated.

240*If a member name contains `.', quote it. (vtables on GDB/Linux)

241 Lev Makhlis <mlev@writeme.com> states that DDD 2.2.3
    (i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1) consistently crashes if he runs it when
    no `~/.ddd/' exists.

243 How come "graph display `echo [a, b, c]`" is not shown as array?

244 Antonello Biancalana <promind@tecnonet.it> reports that DDD, when
    compiled with Motif 2.1, does not show any breakpoint indicators.
    Nor does it show arrows.  This does not happen with Motif 2.0.
