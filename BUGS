# The list of known DDD bugs.

Note: For problems occurring when *building* DDD, see the file `PROBLEMS'.
      For reported bugs that could not yet be reproduced, see `OPENBUGS'.

This is a list of known (i.e. reproducible) DDD bugs, which should be
fixed in some future DDD release.  If you want to fix one or more of
these bugs, please ask us (at ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether there are
already people working on that bug.  Similar, if you find a bug, be
sure to report it to us (at ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) such that we may
fix it (or include it in this list :-)

Projects marked with an `*' are to be fixed in the next DDD release.
Volunteers for fixing these and other bugs are welcome!

001 It's too big and too slow.  [This one will never get fixed]

003 Using Motif 1.1 or earlier, the command window is scrolled
    whenever obscured.  [This seems to be a Motif bug.]

013 Raising windows using the `View' menu does not assign them `mwm'
    input focus.  [Anyone willing to give me a hint here?  -AZ]

021 Using Sun DBX, attempting to dereference a `(nil)' pointer
    results in an error message and no new display.  However, the
    expression is entered as an ordinary display.

026 Using DBX with PASCAL or Modula-2, selected array elements are
    always counted from zero, instead of the starting index of the array.

041 Starting a multi-window DDD iconified under vtwm and fvwm causes
    trouble with group iconification.

049 The bounding box is computed for all boxes, even if only selected
    boxes are to be printed.

126 Flashing data window.  Thomas Liefke
    <liefke@cdc.Informatik.TH-Darmstadt.DE> reports that the data
    window is flashing forever in certain circumstances. The flashing
    looks like a rapid, endless update of the data displayed. The
    flashing only occurs when the panner is used.  While the window
    (i.e. the boxes and the panner) is flashing, another panner is
    occurring in the upper left corner in each flash-cycle.

    The flashing does NOT occur when the scroll bar is used instead of a
    panner.

    How I can reproduce the bug:

    ddd ctest

    now I press:

    break at()
    run
    step
    click on variable 'tree' and select 'display'
    click on box 'tree' and select 'display*'
    click on 'data = {...}' and select 'show detail'

    make the data window smaller so that the lower box doesn't fit
    completely into window

    make the data window big enough for all three boxes.

    Then the window is flashing forever unless I make the window
    smaller and then bigger again.

    When I repeatedly change the size, the flashing comes again but
    not each time the window size is big enough to hold all boxes.

150 In GDB Modula-2-mode, DDD displays are named `^tree' instead of
    `tree^'.  [This is a GDB bug.  Here's a patch for GDB 4.16:

152 Curved edges cannot (yet) be printed.
    [Any PostScript and FIG gurus out there?  -AZ]

155 DBX `dump` output is not understood if local arrays are shown.
    (DBX prints these as `ARRAY')

168 Jens Albrecht <Jens.Albrecht@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
    complains that using DBX, the `file' command does not change the
    source file.

169 The Manual Browser does not recognize manual (sub-)titles for
    ULTRIX and HP-UX `man' formats (probably problems with others, too)

249 Zdenek Sekera <zs@cray.com> reports:

    The 'configure', process is not correct in that the Makefiles
    generated are not "clean". What I mean is this:
 	
    a. When I have done my first complete compilation, I have all the
       *.o everywhere I need (I have also the ddd/ddd* absolute). From
       now on whenever I 'touch' a particular ddd/xxx.c file, I would
       expect with the general Makefile philosophy to recompile only
       xxx.c and nothing else.  This is NOT what happens. A lot more
       gets recompiled.  Even better: after the first compilation, try
       'rm ddd/ddd*' and type 'make'.  Even now something gets
       recompiled, even if I would have expected only the load phase
       should take place.  This is actually quite nasty because I never
       know what other *.o files will be destroyed by recompiling when
       I work on some xxx.c file.
       [This is a problem with some MAKE flavors.  Use GNU make instead.  -AZ]
 
    c. Some Makefiles in the subdirectories do not use CFLAGS thus
       making it neccessary to always edit them to put in the correct
       options.  This is very time consuming in particular on
       (e.g. myself) always forgets at least some little wee thing
       somewhere....
       [This is a problem of the libiberty and librx maintainers.  -AZ]
 
    d. In the same veine, when I run e.g. "configure --prefix='$(HOME)'",
       the $(HOME) does not get propagated to all Makefiles.
       [This is a problem of the libiberty and librx maintainers.  -AZ]

255 In Java programs, the `info set' status display is treated as
    variable list.

262 Ordinarily labeled toolbars don't show up as they should.  Motif
    bug?

272 (LessTif) The `select' font selection method works only once.

281 In auto deiconify mode, the GDB console uniconifies even if other
    windows are already there.

285*Opening a session results in several GDB prompts.

286 (Insert new bugs here)
