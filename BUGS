# The DDD bug list.

Note: For problems occurring when *building* DDD, see the file `PROBLEMS'.

This is a list of known DDD bugs, which should be fixed in some future
DDD release.  If you want to fix one or more of these bugs, please ask
us (at ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether there are already people working
on that bug.  Similar, if you find a bug, be sure to report it to us
(at ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) such that we may fix it (or include it
in this list :-)

Bugs marked with an `*' represent work in progress.
Volunteers for fixing these and other bugs are welcome!

001. It's too big and too slow.  [This one will never get fixed]

002. [fixed]

003. Using Motif 1.1 or earlier, the command window is scrolled
     whenever obscured.  [This seems to be a Motif bug.]

004. [fixed]

005. [fixed]

006. [fixed]

007. [fixed]

008. [fixed]

009. [fixed]

010. On some systems, switching back from running processes in the
     execution window to running processes in the command window does
     not work correctly; processes attempting to read from stdio are
     interrupted with SIGTTIN.  [This is due to the `tty' command in
     GDB, which on some systems messes up tty control when applied to
     the command window pty.  As a workaround, enter a line
     `*useTTYCommand: false' in `~/.dddinit': this will set up an
     alternative redirection scheme].

011. [fixed]

012. [fixed]

013. Raising windows using the `Windows' menu does not assign them `mwm'
     input focus.  [Anyone willing to give me a hint here?  -AZ]

014. [fixed]

015. On Motif 1.2 or later, using DDD with both explicit keyboard
     focus and a panned graph editor causes problems: Keyboard
     traversal of the graph editor does not work; on
     mips-dec-ultrix4.4 (and others?), pointer selection of an
     arbitrary display causes DDD to crash.  [It seems that it is
     generally not wise to combine explicit keyboard focus and panned
     data displays, since this means involving Athena widgets in Motif
     keyboard traversal.  A simple workaround: If you want panners,
     don't use explicit keyboard focus; if you want explicit keyboard
     focus, use scrollbars.]

016. [fixed]

017. On Solaris, exiting DDD while the debugger is still running
     sometimes results in a core dump.

018. [not a DDD bug, forwarded to manual page]

019. [not a DDD bug, forwarded to manual page]

020. [fixed]

021. Using DBX, attempting to dereference a `(nil)' pointer results in
     an error message and no new display.  However, the expression is
     entered as an ordinary display.

022. Doug.Royer@eng.sun.com (Doug Royer [KD6HBW]) states:
     > On Solaris 2.5, when I run it, I get:
     > Warning: Actions not found: select-start, extend-end, doTheRightThing
     > Warning: Actions not found: select-start, extend-end, doTheRightThing
     > Warning: Actions not found: select-start, extend-end, doTheRightThing
     > (gdb)  write failed: Resource temporarily unavailable
     > ddd hangs.
     [We cannot determine what causes this error.  On Solaris 2.4, DDD
      runs fine.]

023. Doug.Royer@eng.sun.com (Doug Royer [KD6HBW]) states:
     > On Solaris 2.5, when I try to 'file->open file...', I get not errors,
     > and nothing happens.
     [Maybe related with 022, above; `Open file' tries to get the
      current directory from GDB and this won't work if GDB hangs.]

024. On mips-sgi-irix5.2, DDD issues a message `(gdb) write failed:
     Bad file number' and hangs.  Reported by ckumarad@oci.utoronto.ca
     (Carl Kumaradas) and baird@asc.on.ca (Warren Baird).  [Anyone
     willing to fix this? The pty is created in `TTYAgent.C', using
     the SGI _getpty() function; the master side is accessed in
     `LiterateA.C'.]

025. DBX on mips-dec-ultrix4 is only partially supported since it has
     an entirely different output format than Sun's DBX.  [If someone
     convinces us that s/he requires ULTRIX DBX support, we'll do it.]

026. Using DBX with PASCAL or Modula-2, selected array elements are
     always counted from zero, instead of the starting index of the array.

027. When displaying virtual function tables with GDB, vtbl entries
     are off by one (due to the GDB feature of telling the number of
     vtbl entries).

028. The `-iconic' option does not work.

029. Displays created by `graph display "abc"' are not parsed
     correctly.

030. [fixed]

031. On Solaris 2.3, DDD dumps core when dereferencing `date_ptrs' in
     the `cxxtest' program.  Reported by
     Herve.Poirier@grenoble.rxrc.xerox.com (Herve Poirier) and
     dana@bellcore.com (Dana A Chee).  [Compiler bug?  Herve's
     backtrace shows strange `r' value for AlignBox::drawAlign()]

032. References are not processed correctly.  Be sure to display the
     part after `:` only.

033. (Insert your bug here)
