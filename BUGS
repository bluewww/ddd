# The DDD bug list.

Note: For problems occurring when *building* DDD, see the file `PROBLEMS'.

This is a list of known DDD bugs, which should be fixed in some future
DDD release.  If you want to fix one or more of these bugs, please ask
us (at ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) whether there are already people working
on that bug.  Similar, if you find a bug, be sure to report it to us
(at ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de) such that we may fix it (or include it
in this list :-)

Projects marked with an `*' are to be fixed in the next DDD release.
Volunteers for fixing these and other bugs are welcome!

001. It's too big and too slow.  [This one will never get fixed]

003. Using Motif 1.1 or earlier, the command window is scrolled
     whenever obscured.  [This seems to be a Motif bug.]

013. Raising windows using the `View' menu does not assign them `mwm'
     input focus.  [Anyone willing to give me a hint here?  -AZ]

021. Using Sun DBX, attempting to dereference a `(nil)' pointer
     results in an error message and no new display.  However, the
     expression is entered as an ordinary display.

026. Using DBX with PASCAL or Modula-2, selected array elements are
     always counted from zero, instead of the starting index of the array.

041. Starting a multi-window DDD iconified under vtwm and fvwm causes
     trouble with group iconification.

049. The bounding box is computed for all boxes, even if only selected
     boxes are to be printed.

086. mayer@paradigml.com (Ron Mayer) says:

     In a number of structures I would attempt to "Modify [the]
     dependent display expression" to display in hex using expressions
     like "/x g->head", instead of the default "(g)->head".

     Occasionally this would make ddd hang, and lock up the X-server
     completely so that I would have to rlogin from another terminal
     to kill the program.  The bus-error was not reproducable, and
     unfortunatelly I had core files disabled when it happened.

     These structures did happen to be in a mmap()'d region of shared
     memory, but since I didn't see the problems when I didn't use the
     "/x" modifier I suspect this isn't the problem.

     PS: What is the prefered way (if any) of making the hex output 
         the default in the display graph?  If I "set output-radix 16" 
         in the gdb window ddd seems to lock up very often.
     [I could not reproduce this bug.  Can anyone clarify this?  -AZ]

113. Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> states:
     If I resize the data display the background doesn't get
     refreshed.  [Use an Athena Panner instead of Motif scrollbars  -AZ]

117. Under Linux slackware 3.1, the file permissions in `/dev/ptyp?'
     do not allow for DDD <-> GDB interaction.  [Can we circumvent
     this within DDD?  -AZ]

118. SGI CC compiles DDD, but the resulting executable soon dies with a
     segmentation fault.  [Use GCC instead.  -AZ]

126. Flashing data window.  Thomas Liefke
     <liefke@cdc.Informatik.TH-Darmstadt.DE> says: 

     The data window is flashing forever in certain circumstances. The
     flashing looks like a rapid, endless update of the data
     displayed. The flashing only occurs when the panner is
     used. While the window (i.e. the boxes and the panner) is
     flashing, another panner is occurring in the upper left corner in
     each flash-cycle.

     The flashing does NOT occur when the scroll bar is used instead of a
     panner.

     How I can reproduce the bug:

     ddd ctest

     now I press:

     break at()
     run
     step
     click on variable 'tree' and select 'display'
     click on box 'tree' and select 'display*'
     click on 'data = {...}' and select 'show detail'

     make the data window smaller so that the lower box doesn't fit
     completely into window

     make the data window big enough for all three boxes.

     Then the window is flashing forever unless I make the window
     smaller and then bigger again.

     When I repeatedly change the size, the flashing comes again but
     not each time the window size is big enough to hold all boxes.
     [I could not reproduce this problem.  -AZ]

     This flashing occurs in the vsl demos as well.

     For example:

     cd ddd-2.0/vsllib
     ../ddd/vsl DEMOS/arcs

     Now the window is flashing until I increase the size of the
     window so that everything fits into it. The flashing doesn't
     occur again when I decrease the window size to the original size.

     The flashing occurs in other demos as well. It doesn't occur in
     DEMOS/bigflow.

     I experienced the flashing neither in version 1.4 nor in version
     2.0beta.
     [This one is easily reproducible, but has low priority.  -AZ]

127. Bob Vickers <bobv@dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk> says that DDD 2.0
     (alpha-dec-osf3.2) sometimes fails to start.  Often it works
     fine. But sometimes, especially if you haven't run it for a while
     (e.g. first thing in the morning) the command window comes up but
     there is no sign of the source window. There are sometimes error
     messages, and these vary slightly.

     The parent Unix window sometimes contains tty error messages, e.g.

     platon$ make check
     ==> Making check in ./ddd...
     make[1]: Entering directory `/nobackup/work/bobv/ddd-2.0/ddd'
     XUSERFILESEARCHPATH=. XAPPLRESDIR=. ./ddd cxxtest
     X Toolkit Warning: Cannot convert string 
     "-*-Menu-Medium-R-Normal--*-120-*-*-P-*-ISO8859-1" to type FontStruct
     (gdb) cannot set terminal foreground process group: I/O error
     (gdb) cannot get slave terminal settings: I/O error

     [We cannot fix this, as we neither have an OSF box nor
      appropriate OSF documentation at our disposition.  The DDD
      distribution comes with a demo program `ttytest' which is useful
      for debugging the TTY interface in `TTYAgent.C'  -AZ]

131. `Find<<' and `Find>>' should be in the `Edit' menu (at least for
     sources)

150. In GDB Modula-2-mode, DDD displays are named `^tree' instead of
     `tree^'.  [This is a GDB bug.  Here's a patch for GDB 4.16:

152. Curved edges cannot (yet) be printed.
     [Any PostScript and FIG gurus out there?  -AZ]

153. Jonathan Edwards <edwards@intranet.com> says that in AIX DBX,
     the local variable display does not display function arguments.
     [May this be due to using AIX xlC instead of GCC?  -AZ]

155. DBX `dump` output is not understood if local arrays are shown.
     (DBX prints these as `ARRAY')

159. Jonathan Edwards <edwards@intranet.com> says:
     A status display only shows once.  After stepping the program it
     collapses into just the title.  Doing a refresh command restores
     the display.
     [This is due to using AIX xlC instead of GCC.  -AZ]

168. Jens Albrecht <Jens.Albrecht@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
     complains that using DBX, the `file' command does not change the
     source file.

169. The Manual Browser does not recognize manual (sub-)titles for
     ULTRIX and HP-UX `man' formats (probably problems with others,
     too)

172. Jonathan Edwards <edwards@intranet.com> says: If I interrupt my
     program while it is running, my data displays are not updated,
     and instead I get the info in the debugger console.

173. Matthias Kurz <mk@baerlap.north.de> says:
     - Often the first graph display is not completely inside the
       window; after selecting 'layout graph' things are right
     [I could not reproduce this. -AZ]

175. Harry Mangalam <mangalam@uci.edu> reports: As soon as I click on
     a variable to try to highlight a structure name, DDD 2.1 goes
     into an unresponsive state for several seconds (seems like up to
     a minute on a 486) in which the ddd process hogs the cpu.  It
     then returns to a usable state until the next time I try to
     highlight a variable name.  It seems that if I click on a simple
     variable name, it responds appopriately, but if I try to
     drag-hilite the name, ddd goes berserk with the cpu.
     [I could not reproduce this. -AZ]

200. With DBX on SunOS 4.1.4, sessions do not work (cannot save core
     file).

203. On IRIX6.3 and DBX, the green arrow indicating the current
     execution position is always at the first line of the currently
     active source file.  Reported by Uwe Wark <uw@bruker.de>

204. Switching from glyphs to text loses the current PC.

211. Graham Hudspith <ghudspit@mltsa.uk.lucent.com> reports that the
     HP-UX version of DDD 2.1.95 crashes at start-up.

213. DDD 2.1.95 does not work with Sun DBX 4.0.  Fred Damen 
     <damenf@cig.mot.com> reports:

     1) The arrow/stop sign do not show. independant of the setting
        for glyphs or text.  They do show when using gdb.

     2) When the execution window is started the string '2>
        /dev/pts/12' gets passed to the debugged program instead of
        being processed by the shell.  I have tcsh as my login shell
        and I suppose that if I had a sh variant as a login shell this
        would work.  Also, when executing 'run' after 'Run in
        execution window' is set to DBX console the string '2>
        /dev/pts/12 < /dev/pts/12 > /dev/pts/12' is passed to the
        debugged program and it seems as though by this time the pty
        12 is already reserved.

     [Should be fixed in DDD 2.2  -AZ]

215. With separate windows, a newly created assembler window has zero
     height.

216. Jonathan Edwards <edwards@intranet.com> suggests that the
     flashing cursor in the gdb console window ought to stop flashing
     during user input.  [Tell the Motif people! -AZ]

218. Conor O'Neill <coneill@integral.ie> reports that, under
     Openwindows on Sparc Solaris2.51, in the Open_File dialog, the
     file_list box is too narrow and does not have a horizontal scroll
     bar. Thus we cannot properly see the list of files available.
     (This problem is not unique to DDD.)

222. Bob Vickers <bobv@dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk> reports that the command tool
     sometimes is really big and occupies most of the screen, thus
     obliterating most of the other windows.  This happens with
     OSF/Motif Version 1.2.4 on alpha-dec-osf4.0.

224* Robert A Kerr <Robert_Kerr@byu.edu> says: On HP-UX 10.10,
     the debugger LED on the bottom right never stops flashing.  If I
     try to do anything it gives me the "The debugger is busy error"
     and keeps flashing away.  I've let it sit for up to an hour
     before and it never stops.

228. Chip Atkinson <chip@XiG.com> and Bernie Borenstein
     <bernieb@deltanet.com> state that after enabling `ungrab mouse
     pointer when interruping modal X application', pressing the right
     mouse button grabs the cursor and won't release.  When ddd is
     killed, the X server cannot give focus to any other windows.
     This happens with Red Hat Linux 4.1 and Metrolink Motif 2.01.

230. Roy Dragseth <royd@math.uit.no> reports that if you type in
     commands really fast in ddd, it gets problems to cope.  When
     using DDD from XEmacs, and defining XEmacs command sequences to
     be sent to DDD, the last command(s) in the sequence get lost.

231. (Insert your bug here)
