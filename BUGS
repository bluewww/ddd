# The list of known DDD bugs (reproduced).

Note: For problems occurring when *building* DDD, see the file `PROBLEMS'.
      For reported bugs that could not yet be reproduced, see `OPENBUGS'.

This is a list of known (i.e. reproducible) DDD bugs, which should be
fixed in some future DDD release.  

If you find a bug, be sure to report it to <ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de>
such that we may fix it (or include it in this list :-)

If you want to fix some of these, please ask <ddd@ips.cs.tu-bs.de>
whether there are already people working on that bug.

Projects marked with an `*' are to be fixed in the next DDD release.
Volunteers for fixing these and other bugs are welcome!

-- list starts here --

001 It's too big and too slow.  [This one will never get fixed]

003 (Motif 1.1) The command window is scrolled whenever obscured.

021 (DBX) Using Sun DBX, attempting to dereference a `(nil)' pointer
    results in an error message and no new display.  However, the
    expression is entered as an ordinary display.

026 (DBX) Using Sun DBX with PASCAL or Modula-2, selected array
    elements are not counted from the starting index of the array.

041 Starting a multi-window DDD iconified under vtwm and fvwm causes
    trouble with group iconification.

126 Flashing data window.  Thomas Liefke
    <liefke@cdc.Informatik.TH-Darmstadt.DE> reports that the data
    window is flashing forever in certain circumstances. The flashing
    looks like a rapid, endless update of the data displayed. The
    flashing only occurs when the panner is used.  While the window
    (i.e. the boxes and the panner) is flashing, another panner is
    occurring in the upper left corner in each flash-cycle.

    The flashing does NOT occur when the scroll bar is used instead of a
    panner.

    How I can reproduce the bug:

    ddd ctest

    now I press:

    break at()
    run
    step
    click on variable 'tree' and select 'display'
    click on box 'tree' and select 'display*'
    click on 'data = {...}' and select 'show detail'

    make the data window smaller so that the lower box doesn't fit
    completely into window

    make the data window big enough for all three boxes.

    Then the window is flashing forever unless I make the window
    smaller and then bigger again.

    When I repeatedly change the size, the flashing comes again but
    not each time the window size is big enough to hold all boxes.

155 (DBX) `dump` output is not understood if local arrays are shown.
    (DBX prints these as `ARRAY')

169 The Manual Browser does not recognize manual (sub-)titles for
    ULTRIX and HP-UX `man' formats (probably problems with others, too)

249 Zdenek Sekera <zs@cray.com> reports:
 
    c. Some Makefiles in the subdirectories do not use CFLAGS thus
       making it neccessary to always edit them to put in the correct
       options.  This is very time consuming in particular on
       (e.g. myself) always forgets at least some little wee thing
       somewhere....
       [This is a problem of the libiberty and librx maintainers.  -AZ]

    d. In the same veine, when I run e.g. "configure --prefix='$(HOME)'",
       the $(HOME) does not get propagated to all Makefiles.
       [This is a problem of the libiberty and librx maintainers.  -AZ]

255 In Java programs, the `info set' status display is treated as
    variable list.

272 (LessTif) The `select' font selection method works only once.

281 In auto deiconify mode, the Debugger Console uniconifies even if
    other DDD windows are already there.

286 (Motif) Changing Cut/Copy/Paste accelerators at runtime does not work.

290 (Motif 1.1) The `Settings' dialog is too wide.

297 Using display commands like `undisplay' directly instead of using
    the `graph' prefix confuses DDD - displays are considered
    `inactive'.

301 (LessTif 0.85) David Zanetti <dave@lynx.co.nz> says:
    1. Tear off edit menu
    2. Select preferences
    3. Select data
    4. Toggle display two dimensional arrays as tables off.
    => X toolkit error: cannot perform realloc
    nb - does _not_ generate the fault if the edit menu is not torn
    off.

307 Marco Hess <marcoh@senet.com.au> says that sometimes, the source
    window locks in scroll mode until it reaches the top or bottom of
    the file.
    [Johan Vermeire <jvme@se.bel.alcatel.be> reports that
     lowering the `glyphUpdateDelay' resource fixes this.]

309 DDD does not run correctly with the CDE Window Manager.  Michael
    Marxmeier <mike@msede.com> and Stefan von Dombrowski
    <Stefan.von.Dombrowski@dlr.de> state that every time you move the
    main window a constant offset is added to the relative position of
    the tool window. This has the effect that the tool window at last
    moves to the lower left of the screen.

    Every time you change the location of the source window, the
    distance shrinks.  The border_width structure member
    (XWindowAttributes) seems to be always zero in
    recenter_tool_shell() although no error is returned. When the new
    cmd window position is calculated this will result in a slight
    move.

311 After `next 4' on Solaris DBX, the current position is not
    highlighted.

313 Mihai Budiu <mihaib@gs41.sp.cs.cmu.edu> reports:
    The displayed items move each time one is resized (which happens
    because the field values change dimensions); it should be nice to
    be able to pin them down to a location (even if the windows will
    end-up overlapping), because the heuristic to choose their places
    tends to put them very far.

316*Alias hints of clustered displays remain in place.
    (Create a DispGraph::cluster() routine, like DispGraph::make_active()).

322*Finish Plots:
    - Draw scalars as (rotatable) lines
    - Give a diagnostic when plot did not succeed
    - Add menu for printing
    - Add menu for line styles
    - Add a delay dialog (similar to launching xterm)
    - Add Gnuplot console
    - Make swallowing (decorating) optional
    - Destroying plotter decorations is risky; better re-use them
    - Document it all

330 Oliver Eichler <oliver.eichler@regensburg.netsurf.de> suggests
    that the `Displays' cluster should have two or more columns in
    order to fit the visible part of the display.

331*Paul Sydney <sydney@ulua.mhpcc.af.mil>, Jim Van Zandt
    <jrv@mbunix.mitre.org>, and Bob Full <roundman@biz-tech.net>
    report `MakeMenu' problems with EGCS.

333 Text character breakpoints are not displayed in empty lines
    with zero indentation.

335 Hiding a cluster and re-showing it does not work correctly.
