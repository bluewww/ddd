DDD CONFIGURATION
-----------------
DDD 3.1.1 (powerpc-ibm-aix4.3.1.0), Copyright (C) 1998 TU Braunschweig.
Compiled with CC
Requires X11R6, Xt11R6, Motif 2.1 (Motif Version 2.1.0)
Includes DDD core, manual, app-defaults, XPM 3.4.10, Athena Panner
Built 1998-12-08 by Eric Blinn <qablinn@146.122.9.68>.


INFERIOR DEBUGGER
-----------------
I am using dbx as shipped with IBM AIX 4.3.1.0.


COMPILER USED TO COMPILE DDD
----------------------------
I used IBM xlC 3.6.4 to compile DDD.


DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR
-----------------------------------
In the source window, the pointer to the next source line to be executed
does not show up. This is the case for both a glyph pointer and a text
based pointer. The text cursor _does_ seem to show up in the right
place, which gives some indication of what the next source line to be
executed is, as long as I don't move the cursor manually (such as doing
a cut and paste operation). I suspect an interaction issue with dbx and
have been trying to debug the problem, but I'd like to get the issue in
front of someone with better knowledge of DDD internals. The DDD log
file follows:
