Problems in building and installing DDD                          -*- text -*-
***************************************

AIX
===

Reported by:  bas@phys.uva.nl (Bas V. de Bakker),
              smueller@dbis1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (Stefan Mueller)

    `ddd.C' won't compile on rs6000-ibm-aix3 and powerpc-ibm-aix3, due
    to an error message from the assembler.  According to Stefan
    Mueller and Bas V. de Bakker, the problem disappears when DDD is
    compiled without `-O'.  Stefan Mueller also states that GCC chokes
    on `BreakPoint.C'; it can only be compiled without
    `-felide-constructors' flag.

    [David C. Snyder <dsnyder@mindspring.com> states that he did not
    encounter any such problems using GNU binutils-2.6, gcc-2.7.2,
    libg++-2.7.1, and gdb-4.15.1 on his AIX 3.2.5 system.]

    We recommend the following simple way to build DDD on AIX:
    
    1. Enter `make -k'.  This builds all except erroneous files.

    2. In the `ddd' subdirectory, enter 
       `make CXXOPT= CXXSTUFF=-fexternal-templates'.  This builds
       the remainder of DDD without `-O' and `-felide-constructors'
       flags.

    This "howto" describes the way one can get ddd-2.0 compiled on AIX 3.2
    using standard AIX utilities: C Set ++ for AIX Compiler (xlC), lex
    and yacc. The same procedure should be valid on AIX 4.1.

    First unpack the source distribution and go to the ddd-2.0
    subdirectory.  Then (an error in the configure script) make
    a copy of ./ddd/dummy.c:
            cp ./ddd/dummy.c ./ddd/dummy.c.orig

    Then set some environment variables:
            export CC=xlC
            export CXX=xlC
            export CFLAGS=-O
            export CXXFLAGS=-O
            export LDFLAGS=-O

    If you decide NOT to use gnu gcc, flex, and bison you may also
    need to remove the /usr/local/bin (or any other subdirectory where
    you keep gnu executables) from the PATH environment variable (so
    that the ./configure script will not find them, and it will find
    standard AIX xlC, lex, and yacc).

    Then run configure:
            ./configure -v

    Then restore the ddd/dummy.c:
            cp ./ddd/dummy.c.orig ./ddd/dummy.c

    Then in ./libiberty/Makefile and ./termcap/Makefile change the
    CFLAGS from "-g" into "-O".

    Then in ./ddd/config.h add a line in form:
            #define HAVE_GETHOSTNAME_DECL 1
    (On AIX 4.1 you should have it already defined by ./configure.)

    If you decide NOT to use gnu flex and gnu bison and use
    standard AIX lex and yacc instead, you have to remove some
    files:
            rm ./ddd/vsl-gramma.C ./ddd/vsl-gramma.h ./ddd/vsl-lex.C

    Now run "make clean" and then "make".

    If you decided to use standard AIX lex and yacc the make will
    crash while compiling ddd/VSLRead.C. You have to edit
    ./ddd/vsl-gramma.C (after the ./ddd/vsl-gramma.C is newly
    created by yacc) and modify the declaration of yyerror:
            extern "C" void yyerror(char *s);       // added "C"

    and the definition of yyparse:
            #ifdef __cplusplus
            // extern "C"                           // commented extern "C"
            #endif /* __cplusplus */
            int
            yyparse()

    then run "make" again.  You should get no other warnings/errors.
    Finally run "make strip" and "make install".  Have fun ...



FreeBSD
=======

Reported by:  taob@gate.sinica.edu.tw (Brian Tao)

    Use `gmake' (GNU make) instead of `make' for building DDD.

Reported by: Vincenzo Capuano <vcapuano@esoc.esa.de>

    Add `-lmytinfo' as additional library to build DDD.


GCC 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
=================

    Lots and lots of warnings; nearly all of them insignificant.


GCC and LIBG++
==============

    If you have multiple copies of gcc and/or libg++ installed, be
    sure that the referenced versions match each other.  This is a
    common source for various problems.


HP-UX
=====

Reported by:  Graham Hudspith <ghudspit@mltsa.uk.lucent.com>

    On HP-UX 10.20, use `-O2' instead of `-O3' to compile. In
    `ddd/Makefile', change CXXOPT from being '-DNDEBUG -O3' to be
    '-DNDEBUG -O2'.  When DDD is compiled with -O3 on HPs under HP-UX
    10.20, it will crash at start-up; when compiled with -O2,
    everything is fine.


Reported by:  (various)

    Various linking problems have been reported.  This is probably due
    to an error in the HP-UX linker.  According to some DDD users, the
    problem can be solved by using patched versions of the GNU
    binutils (such as ld and ar) instead of the HP-UX binutils.  For
    more information on HP-PA versions of the GNU tools, see
    `ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/dist/pagnutools.html'.

    Ivar Ruyter <ivarr@troll.hz.kfa-juelich.de> states: Build
    everything statically and add `-l:libdld.sl' to the LIBS line in
    the Makefile, voila you have a nice new Christmas Present.
    This also worked for Hal Manuel <hemanuel@esy.com>.

    Roy Dragseth <royd@math.uit.no> adds:
    Statically link as stated above. Actually it is only
    neccessary to statically link libXm, so if you exchange 
            -L/usr/lib/Motif1.2 -lXm
    with
            /usr/lib/Motif1.2/libXm.a
    in the link step DDD works fine. This might be useful for people
    who don't have the gnu linker. It also makes the executable ~1Mb
    smaller than when you add -l:libdld.sl to the link step.

    Lassi A. Tuura <Lassi.Tuura@cern.ch> suggests to use the option
    `-fmillicode-long-calls' when compiling.  It should permit fixes
    into shared library calls (these errors only occur with shared
    libraries).


LESSTIF
=======

    Here is a list of known DDD problems, occurring when linking DDD with
    LessTif instead of OSF/Motif.  These bugs should be fixed in some
    future release of DDD and/or LessTif.  Unless otherwise noted, all
    bugs refer to DDD 2.0 compiled against LessTif 0.75a.

    DDD is available via `http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/'.
    LessTif is available via `http://www.hungry.com/products/'.

    001. The debugger console  (the place where you can enter GDB
         commands) displays only one line.  [behavioral]
        
         Fix: in `ddd/Ddd.in', comment out the lines limiting the size of the
         `gdb_w' scrolled window:

    002. The source argument field `()' is not updated (i.e. when
         clicking on some source item)  [behavioral]
        
         Cause: XmText does not yet support selections.
         `XmTextGetSelectionPositon' is not implemented.
    
    003. The source popup menu (clicking the right mouse button when

         do not work.  [behavioral]
    
    006. `Preferences' buttons (Options->Preferences) stick out.
         There should be no 3d-border around the four preferences
         buttons.  [visual]
    
    007. The `Preferences' panel size (below buttons) is incorrect.  With
         OSF/Motif, it extends to the maximum size of the four
         preference panels (i.e. the `Startup preferences' panel).
         With LessTif, it extends to the size of the first preference
         panel.  The code to handle the panel size is in `add_panel()'
         in `ddd/ddd.C'.  [visual]
    
    008. Option buttons show `OptionButton' instead of the given label
         string.  [visual]
    
    009. The `Settings' panel (Options->Settings) is not scrolled.
         [behavioral]
    
    010. Paned windows don't work.  Dragging sashes has strange
         effects.  [behavioral]
    
    011. The `F1' menu accelerator (Help->On Context) has no effect.
         [behavioral]
    
    012. Moving `Up' or `Down' in the `Backtrace' window
         (Stack->Backtrace) does not clear the last selection.  Only
         one line should be selected.  [behavioral]
    
    014. In the DDD manual (Help->DDD Manual), selecting a title on the
         left causes the cursor to jump on the appropriate section in
         the right, but the window is not scrolled such that the
         section is at the top.  [behavioral]


LINUX
=====

Reported by: Jim Van Zandt <jrv@vanzandt.mv.com>

     Under slackware 3.1, the file permissions in `/dev/ptyp?' do not
     allow for DDD <-> GDB interaction.  I did "cd /dev; rm pty*;
     MAKEDEV ptyp ptyq ptys ptyt", the former permissions and device
     numbers were restored, and DDD worked.
     [Can anyone tell me how to circumvent this within DDD?  - AZ]

Reported by:  Bernie Borenstein <c372321@hc1056.mdc.com>

     Make sure you use libc version 4.6.27 or later.  Otherwise some
     Motif versions will cause DDD to crash as soon as `Open
     Program...' is selected (or any other file selection dialog is
     opened).  Linux Motif's are very sensitive about this.

     As an intermediate workaround, use the GDB `file' and `core'
     commands; to open a specific source, use the GDB `info file
     FUNCTION' command, where FUNCTION is a function defined in that
     source file.

Reported by:  Andreas Zeller <zeller@acm.org>

     Some Motif versions cause DDD to crash when dragging & dropping
     breakpoint symbols.  Being written for Motif 1.x, there is no
     special drag & drop handling in DDD; if DDD crashes upon drag &
     drop, this is a bug in your Motif library.


SGI
===

Reported by:  Andreas Zeller <zeller@acm.org>

    Don't use SGI CC for compiling DDD; use GCC instead.

    I compiled DDD on a mips-sgi-irix5.3 using SGI's CC; the resulting
    executable fails with segmentation faults.  I could not find the
    cause for this problem and suspect a CC bug; using GCC instead
    seems a better alternative.


Solaris 2.x
===========

Reported by:  Blair Zajac <blair@olympia.gps.caltech.edu>

    When using Sun cc to compile `libiberty' as shipped with DDD, change
    `extern char *__builtin_alloca();' to `extern void
    *__builtin_alloca();' in `alloca-norm.h' to get the code to compile.
    This does not happen with GCC.


SunOS 4.1 and X11R6
===================

Reported by:  dmitzel@everest.hitc.com (Danny J. Mitzel) and
    doko@cs.tu-berlin.de (Matthias Klose)

    Using certain Motif and Athena libraries may cause
    `_vendorShellWidgetClass' to be defined twice.  A possible
    workaround is to configure DDD to run without Athena widgets
    (i.e. in `config.h', undefine `HAVE_ATHENA_WIDGETS' and remove the
    -lXaw flag from the `Makefile' linking command).

SunOS 4.1 and Sun C++
=====================

Reported by:	Franklin Chen <chen@adi.com>

    On SunOS 4.1.x, with Sun C++ 4.0.1, config.h needs to end up with
        #define SIGHANDLERARGS int, ...
    rather than
        #define SIGHANDLERARGS int
    to avoid compile errors in a number of source files.


UNIXWARE
========

Reported by: Vinnie Shelton  <shelton@icd.teradyne.com>

    For Unixware, I have to set up `ddd/Makefile' as follows 
    after configuration:

    LINK.cc = env LD_RUN_PATH=/usr/X11R6/lib $(CXX) $(CXXBINDING) $(LDFLAGS)


X11R4
=====

Reported by:  mlj@gensym.com (Magnus Ljungberg)

    You may need to prohibit the use of the _XEditResCheckMessages()
    function by entering a line saying '#undef HAVE_X11_XMU_EDITRES_H' in
    `ddd.C'.


ADA
===

Reported by: ralph@ifr.luftfahrt.uni-stuttgart.de (Ralph Paul)

    Debugging Ada programs requires a special GDB version, for
    instance the one at `ftp://helen.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/gdb'.
