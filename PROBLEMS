Problems in building and installing DDD                          -*- text -*-
***************************************

Note: For problems occurring when *running* DDD, see the file `BUGS'.

AIX
===

Reported by:  bas@phys.uva.nl (Bas V. de Bakker),
              smueller@dbis1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (Stefan Mueller)

    `ddd.C' won't compile on rs6000-ibm-aix3 and powerpc-ibm-aix3, due
    to an error message from the assembler.  According to Stefan
    Mueller and Bas V. de Bakker, the problem disappears when DDD is
    compiled without `-O'.  Stefan Mueller also states that GCC chokes
    on `BreakPoint.C'; it can only be compiled without
    `-felide-constructors' flag.

    We recommend the following simple way to build DDD on AIX:
    
    1. Enter `make -k'.  This builds all except erroneous files.

    2. In the `ddd' subdirectory, enter 
       `make CXXOPT= CXXSTUFF=-fexternal-templates'.  This builds
       the remainder of DDD without `-O' and `-felide-constructors' flags.

    Note that DBX support has only been tested on Suns; DBX on AIX may be
    a quite different program.


FreeBSD
=======

Reported by:  taob@gate.sinica.edu.tw (Brian Tao)

    Use `gmake' (GNU make) instead of `make' for building DDD.


HP-UX
=====

    Various linking problems have been reported.  This is probably due
    to an error in the HP-UX linker.


SunOS 4.1 and X11R6
===================

Reported by:  dmitzel@everest.hitc.com (Danny J. Mitzel) and
    doko@cs.tu-berlin.de (Matthias Klose)

    Using certain Motif and Athena libraries may cause
    `_vendorShellWidgetClass' to be defined twice.  A possible
    workaround is to configure DDD to run without Athena widgets
    (i.e. in `config.h', undefine `HAVE_ATHENA_WIDGETS' and remove the
    -lXaw flag from the `Makefile' linking command).


X11R4
=====

Reported by:  mlj@gensym.com (Magnus Ljungberg)

    You may need to prohibit the use of the _XEditResCheckMessages()
    function by entering a line saying '#undef HAVE_X11_XMU_EDITRES_H' in
    `ddd.C'.
