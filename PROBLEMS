Problems in building and installing DDD                          -*- text -*-
***************************************

AIX
===

    `ddd.C' won't compile on rs6000-ibm-aix3 and powerpc-ibm-aix3, due
    to an error message from the assembler.  According to Stefan
    Mueller and Bas V. de Bakker, the problem disappears when DDD is
    compiled without `-O'.  Stefan Mueller also states that GCC chokes
    on `BreakPoint.C'; it can only be compiled without
    `-felide-constructors' flag.

    We recommend the following simple way to build DDD on AIX:
    
    1. Enter `make -k'.  This builds all except erroneous files.

    2. In the `ddd' subdirectory, enter 
       `make CXXOPT= CXXSTUFF=-fexternal-templates'.  This builds
       the remainder of DDD without `-O' and `-felide-constructors' flags.

    Note that DBX support has only been tested on Suns; DBX on AIX may be
    a quite different program.


Alpha OSF
=========

Reported by:  Walter Tuppa <tuppa@iue.tuwien.ac.at>

     Building DDD on Alpha OSF brings some difficulties, since librx.a
     (the GNU regular expression library) is not 64-bit clean.  The
     following procedure should work:

     1. Configure DDD as stated in the installation guide.

     2. `librx' must be compiled using the native `cc' compiler, using
        the `-taso' flag.  Set `CC = cc -taso' in `librx/Makefile'.

     3. `ddd' can be compiled using GCC, but requires the `-taso' flag
         to be set as well.  Search for the definition of `COMPILE.cc' in
         `ddd/Makefile'.  Add a `-taso' flag after `$(CXX)'.

     4. `ddd' should be linked using the native `cc' compiler, again
         using the `-taso' flag.  Search for the definition of
         `LINK.cc' in `ddd/Makefile'.  Replace `$(CXX)' by `cc -taso'.

     5. Build DDD as recommended.

     These steps make the DDD binary use only a 31-bit address space
     and avoid problems between integer and pointer conversion.


FreeBSD
=======

Reported by:  taob@gate.sinica.edu.tw (Brian Tao)

    Use `gmake' (GNU make) instead of `make' for building DDD.

Reported by: Vincenzo Capuano <vcapuano@esoc.esa.de>

    Add `-lmytinfo' as additional library to build DDD.


GCC 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
=================

    Lots and lots of warnings; nearly all of them insignificant.


HP-UX
=====

    Various linking problems have been reported.  This is probably due
    to an error in the HP-UX linker.  According to some DDD users, the
    problem can be solved by using patched versions of the GNU
    binutils (such as ld and ar) instead of the HP-UX binutils.
    For more information on HP-PA versions of the GNU tools, see
    `ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/dist/pagnutools.html'.

    Ivar Ruyter <ivarr@troll.hz.kfa-juelich.de> states: Build
    everything statically and add `-l:libdld.sl' to the LIBS line in
    the Makefile, voila you have a nice new Christmas Present.


LINUX
=====

Reported by: Ronald Wahl <Ronald.Wahl@Informatik.TU-Chemnitz.DE>

     Remove the double `-lc' when linking DDD to avoid a
     segmentation fault immediately after startup.


Reported by:  Bernie Borenstein <c372321@hc1056.mdc.com>

     Make sure you use libc version 4.6.27 or later.  Otherwise some
     Motif versions will cause DDD to crash as soon as `Open
     Program...' is selected (or any other file selection dialog is
     opened).  Linux Motif's are very sensitive about this.

     As an intermediate workaround, use the GDB `file' and `core'
     commands; to open a specific source, use the GDB `info file
     FUNCTION' command, where FUNCTION is a function defined in that
     source file.



SunOS 4.1 and X11R6
===================

Reported by:  dmitzel@everest.hitc.com (Danny J. Mitzel) and
    doko@cs.tu-berlin.de (Matthias Klose)

    Using certain Motif and Athena libraries may cause
    `_vendorShellWidgetClass' to be defined twice.  A possible
    workaround is to configure DDD to run without Athena widgets
    (i.e. in `config.h', undefine `HAVE_ATHENA_WIDGETS' and remove the
    -lXaw flag from the `Makefile' linking command).


X11R4
=====

Reported by:  mlj@gensym.com (Magnus Ljungberg)

    You may need to prohibit the use of the _XEditResCheckMessages()
    function by entering a line saying '#undef HAVE_X11_XMU_EDITRES_H' in
    `ddd.C'.
