Problems in building and installing DDD                          -*- text -*-
***************************************

AIX
===

Reported by:  bas@phys.uva.nl (Bas V. de Bakker),
              smueller@dbis1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (Stefan Mueller)

    `ddd.C' won't compile on rs6000-ibm-aix3 and powerpc-ibm-aix3, due
    to an error message from the assembler.  According to Stefan
    Mueller and Bas V. de Bakker, the problem disappears when DDD is
    compiled without `-O'.  Stefan Mueller also states that GCC chokes
    on `BreakPoint.C'; it can only be compiled without
    `-felide-constructors' flag.

    [David C. Snyder <dsnyder@mindspring.com> states that he did not
    encounter any such problems using GNU binutils-2.6, gcc-2.7.2,
    libg++-2.7.1, and gdb-4.15.1 on his AIX 3.2.5 system.]

    We recommend the following simple way to build DDD on AIX:
    
    1. Enter `make -k'.  This builds all except erroneous files.

    2. In the `ddd' subdirectory, enter 
       `make CXXOPT= CXXSTUFF=-fexternal-templates'.  This builds
       the remainder of DDD without `-O' and `-felide-constructors' flags.

    Note that DBX support has only been tested on Suns; DBX on AIX may be
    a quite different program.


FreeBSD
=======

Reported by:  taob@gate.sinica.edu.tw (Brian Tao)

    Use `gmake' (GNU make) instead of `make' for building DDD.

Reported by: Vincenzo Capuano <vcapuano@esoc.esa.de>

    Add `-lmytinfo' as additional library to build DDD.


GCC 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
=================

    Lots and lots of warnings; nearly all of them insignificant.


HP-UX
=====

    Various linking problems have been reported.  This is probably due
    to an error in the HP-UX linker.  According to some DDD users, the
    problem can be solved by using patched versions of the GNU
    binutils (such as ld and ar) instead of the HP-UX binutils.
    For more information on HP-PA versions of the GNU tools, see
    `ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/dist/pagnutools.html'.

    Ivar Ruyter <ivarr@troll.hz.kfa-juelich.de> states: Build
    everything statically and add `-l:libdld.sl' to the LIBS line in
    the Makefile, voila you have a nice new Christmas Present.


LINUX
=====

Reported by: Ronald Wahl <Ronald.Wahl@Informatik.TU-Chemnitz.DE>

     Remove the double `-lc' when linking DDD to avoid a
     segmentation fault immediately after startup.


Reported by:  Bernie Borenstein <c372321@hc1056.mdc.com>

     Make sure you use libc version 4.6.27 or later.  Otherwise some
     Motif versions will cause DDD to crash as soon as `Open
     Program...' is selected (or any other file selection dialog is
     opened).  Linux Motif's are very sensitive about this.

     As an intermediate workaround, use the GDB `file' and `core'
     commands; to open a specific source, use the GDB `info file
     FUNCTION' command, where FUNCTION is a function defined in that
     source file.


SGI
===

Reported by:  Pavol Federl <federl@cpsc.ucalgary.ca>

    I tried to compile ddd on an SGI Indy (Irix5.3), and after using
    the 'configure' script, I typed 'make', and I got an error
    message:

        target=all: Command not found.
        *** Error code 1 (bu21)

    So I added 'SHELL = /bin/sh' to the top of the Makefile (since
    SHELL wasn't declared), and that fixed the problem.  Otherwise, it
    compiled ok, except some warnings.


Solaris 2.x
===========

Reported by:  Blair Zajac <blair@olympia.gps.caltech.edu>

    When using Sun cc to compile `libiberty' as shipped with DDD, change
    `extern char *__builtin_alloca();' to `extern void
    *__builtin_alloca();' in `alloca-norm.h' to get the code to compile.
    This does not happen with GCC.


SunOS 4.1 and X11R6
===================

Reported by:  dmitzel@everest.hitc.com (Danny J. Mitzel) and
    doko@cs.tu-berlin.de (Matthias Klose)

    Using certain Motif and Athena libraries may cause
    `_vendorShellWidgetClass' to be defined twice.  A possible
    workaround is to configure DDD to run without Athena widgets
    (i.e. in `config.h', undefine `HAVE_ATHENA_WIDGETS' and remove the
    -lXaw flag from the `Makefile' linking command).


X11R4
=====

Reported by:  mlj@gensym.com (Magnus Ljungberg)

    You may need to prohibit the use of the _XEditResCheckMessages()
    function by entering a line saying '#undef HAVE_X11_XMU_EDITRES_H' in
    `ddd.C'.


ADA
===

Reported by: ralph@ifr.luftfahrt.uni-stuttgart.de (Ralph Paul)

    Debugging Ada programs requires a special GDB version, for
    instance the one at `ftp://helen.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/gdb'.
