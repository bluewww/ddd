Problems in building and installing DDD                          -*- text -*-

    `ddd.C' won't compile on rs6000-ibm-aix3 and powerpc-ibm-aix3, due
    to an error message from the assembler.  According to Stefan
    Mueller and Bas V. de Bakker, the problem disappears when DDD is
    compiled without `-O'.  Stefan Mueller also states that GCC chokes
    on `BreakPoint.C'; it can only be compiled without
    `-felide-constructors' flag.

    We recommend the following simple way to build DDD on AIX:
    
    1. Enter `make -k'.  This builds all except erroneous files.

    2. In the `ddd' subdirectory, enter 
       `make CXXOPT= CXXSTUFF=-fexternal-templates'.  This builds
       the remainder of DDD without `-O' and `-felide-constructors' flags.

    Note that DBX support has only been tested on Suns; DBX on AIX may be
    a quite different program.
