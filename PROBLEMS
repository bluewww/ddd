Problems in building and installing DDD                          -*- text -*-
***************************************

Note: For problems occurring when *running* DDD, see the file `BUGS'.

AIX
===

Reported by:  bas@phys.uva.nl (Bas V. de Bakker),
              smueller@dbis1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (Stefan Mueller)

    `ddd.C' won't compile on rs6000-ibm-aix3 and powerpc-ibm-aix3, due
    to an error message from the assembler.  According to Stefan
    Mueller and Bas V. de Bakker, the problem disappears when DDD is
    compiled without `-O'.  Stefan Mueller also states that GCC chokes
    on `BreakPoint.C'; it can only be compiled without
    `-felide-constructors' flag.

    We recommend the following simple way to build DDD on AIX:
    
    1. Enter `make -k'.  This builds all except erroneous files.

    2. In the `ddd' subdirectory, enter 
       `make CXXOPT= CXXSTUFF=-fexternal-templates'.  This builds
       the remainder of DDD without `-O' and `-felide-constructors' flags.

    Note that DBX support has only been tested on Suns; DBX on AIX may be
    a quite different program.


FreeBSD
=======

Reported by:  taob@gate.sinica.edu.tw (Brian Tao)

    Use `gmake' (GNU make) instead of `make' for building DDD.


HP-UX
=====

    Various linking problems have been reported.  This is probably due
    to an error in the HP-UX linker.  According to some DDD users, the
    problem can be solved by using GNU binutils (such as ld and ar)
    instead of the HP-UX binutils.


SunOS 4.1 and X11R6
===================

Reported by:  dmitzel@everest.hitc.com (Danny J. Mitzel) and
    doko@cs.tu-berlin.de (Matthias Klose)

    Using certain Motif and Athena libraries may cause
    `_vendorShellWidgetClass' to be defined twice.  A possible
    workaround is to configure DDD to run without Athena widgets
    (i.e. in `config.h', undefine `HAVE_ATHENA_WIDGETS' and remove the
    -lXaw flag from the `Makefile' linking command).


X11R4
=====

Reported by:  mlj@gensym.com (Magnus Ljungberg)

    You may need to prohibit the use of the _XEditResCheckMessages()
    function by entering a line saying '#undef HAVE_X11_XMU_EDITRES_H' in
    `ddd.C'.


LINUX
=====

     Several Motif distributions for Linux have a bug causing DDD to
     crash on some machines as soon as `Open Program...' is selected
     (or any other file selection dialog is opened).  Go and complain
     to your Motif vendor in order to get an upgrade.  
     We have Linux DDD binaries linked with a fixed SWiM Motif 2.0
     library available.  As a workaround, use the GDB `file' and
     `core' commands; to open a specific source, use the GDB `info
     file FUNCTION' command, where FUNCTION is a function defined in
     that source file.


Alpha OSF
=========

Reported by:  Walter Tuppa <tuppa@iue.tuwien.ac.at>

     Building DDD on Alpha OSF brings some difficulties, since librx.a
     (the GNU regular expression library) is not 64-bit clean.  The
     following procedure should work:

     1. Configure DDD as stated in the installation guide.

     2. `librx' must be compiled using the native `cc' compiler, using
        the `-taso' flag.  Set `CC = cc -taso' in `librx/Makefile'.

     3. `ddd' can be compiled using GCC, but requires the `-taso' flag
         to be set as well.  Search for the definition of `COMPILE.cc' in
         `ddd/Makefile'.  Add a `-taso' flag after `$(CXX)'.

     4. `ddd' should be linked using the native `cc' compiler, again
         using the `-taso' flag.  Search for the definition of
         `LINK.cc' in `ddd/Makefile'.  Replace `$(CXX)' by `cc -taso'.

     5. Build DDD as recommended.

     These steps make the DDD binary use only a 31-bit address space
     and avoid problems between integer and pointer conversion.


GCC 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
=================

    Lots and lots of warnings; nearly all of them insignificant.
