# Getting DDD from the public CVS Archive

DDD now has a public CVS archive (hosted at SourceForge) where you can
download arbitrary DDD releases (typically the latest one).  Using
your local CVS version, you can always download the latest changes and
thus stay in sync with DDD development.

To checkout and build DDD from the public CVS archive, follow these steps:

1. Check the DDD repository for latest news.  Go to:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddd/


2. Check your prerequisites. 

   The CVS repository does not contain derived files, only DDD
   sources.  Hence, you need several tools on your local machine for
   building DDD.

   A list of the most important tools can be found in the DDD
   `INSTALL' file, as `tools you need if you make changes to the DDD
   sources'.  All these tools are required.


3. Checkout DDD.  Use these commands:

       $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ddd.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ddd login

   If you are prompted for a password, just hit Enter.

    $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ddd.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ddd \
      checkout -kkv ddd

   This creates a `ddd/' subdirectory containing all DDD code.

   The `-kkv' option is required to expand RCS keywords, thus allowing
   prompt version identification.  `-z3' enables compression.


4. After successful checkout, have a look at `ddd/README-CVS' for the
   most recent version of this document.


5. Setup the distribution.  DDD includes a `CVSMake' script that does
   the job for you.  Change to the DDD top-level directory

       $ cd ddd

   and enter

       $ sh ./CVSMake

   Messages about missing `.in' or `ChangeLog' files can be safely ignored.

   Note: You may require special tools to setup the distribution,
   including `automake', `aclocal', `flex', `bison' and `makeinfo'.
   If `CVSMake' fails at some point, install the necessary package and
   simply run `CVSMake' again.

   Note: running `CVSMake' takes some time (over 1 minute on Andrew's
   Pentium-M 1500).


6. If all went well, you can now re-configure, build, and install DDD
   as described in the `INSTALL' file.  Example commands:

	$ sh ./configure
	$ make
	$ make check


7. `CVSMake' and `make', as described above, do not generate formatted
   documentation (i.e. PDF and HTML files).  It is suggested that you
   use formatted documentation from the DDD distributions.

   However, you can create formatted documentation from source.  For
   this, you need several typesetting and graphics tools, such as
   LaTeX, PDFLaTeX, netpbm, pbmplus, ImageMagick, ... 
   The `INSTALL' file has a list.

   To create formatted documentation from source, type

	$ make diststuff


8. You can always sync with the current development state by using

	$ cvs update

   and rebuild DDD using `make'.
