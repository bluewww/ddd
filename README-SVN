# Getting DDD from the public SVN Archive

DDD now has a public Subversion archive (hosted at Savannah) where you can
download arbitrary DDD releases (typically the latest one).  Using
your local SVN version, you can always download the latest changes and
thus stay in sync with DDD development.

To checkout and build DDD from the public SVN archive, follow these steps:

1. Check the DDD repository for latest news.  Go to:

   http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/ddd/


2. Check your prerequisites. 

   The SVN repository does not contain derived files, only DDD
   sources.  Hence, you need several tools on your local machine for
   building DDD.

   A list of the most important tools can be found in the DDD
   `INSTALL' file, as `tools you need if you make changes to the DDD
   sources'.  All these tools are required.


3. Checkout DDD.  Use either of these commands:

    $ svn co svn://svn.savannah.gnu.org/ddd/trunk ddd
    $ svn co http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/svn/ddd/trunk ddd

   The svn: protocol is faster, but may not be allowed if you are
   behind a firewall.

   This creates a `ddd/' subdirectory containing all DDD code.

4. After successful checkout, have a look at `ddd/README-SVN' for the
   most recent version of this document.


5. Setup the distribution.  DDD includes a `CVSMake' script that does
   the job for you.  Change to the DDD top-level directory

       $ cd ddd

   and enter

       $ sh ./CVSMake

   Messages about missing `.in' or `ChangeLog' files can be safely ignored.

   Note: You may require special tools to setup the distribution,
   including `automake', `aclocal', `flex', `bison' and `makeinfo'.
   If `CVSMake' fails at some point, install the necessary package and
   simply run `CVSMake' again.

   Note: running `CVSMake' takes some time (over 1 minute on Andrew's
   Pentium-M 1500).


6. If all went well, you can now re-configure, build, and install DDD
   as described in the `INSTALL' file.  Example commands:

	$ sh ./configure
	$ make
	$ make check


7. `CVSMake' and `make', as described above, do not generate formatted
   documentation (i.e. PDF and HTML files).  It is suggested that you
   use formatted documentation from the DDD distributions.

   However, you can create formatted documentation from source.  For
   this, you need several typesetting and graphics tools, such as
   LaTeX, PDFLaTeX, netpbm, pbmplus, ImageMagick, ... 
   The `INSTALL' file has a list.

   To create formatted documentation from source, type

	$ make diststuff


8. You can always sync with the current development state by using

	$ svn update

   and rebuild DDD using `make'.
