Installing DDD					-*- text -*-
**************

PLEASE NOTE: The compiler required to build DDD has changed as of 3.3.6.
Be sure to read the instructions below carefully.

For compiling and installing DDD on a system, please follow these
instructions.


Build Requirements
==================

To build a complete DDD from sources, you need:

   * The GNU C++ compiler (3.1 or later), including a matching
     C++ I/O runtime library (libstdc++ or libg++).

     Some other C++ compilers have been reported to compile DDD as well;
     current development is taking place with g++ 3.2.3 and 3.4.0, so that is
     what we recommend.  Older gcc releases will not work, as they are not
     nearly ISO C++ conformant.  If you are building with a compiler that
     is not g++, be sure to read the PROBLEMS file.

   * A M*tif Widget library.  Either

     - LessTif, 0.90 or later, or
     - OSF/Motif (1.2 or later).

     We recommend to use LessTif 0.92 or later, available from
     `http://www.lesstif.org/'.  

     Please note: LessTif can be built and installed as M*tif
     1.2-compatible version and as M*tif 2.0-compatible version.
     LessTif packages normally install both versions, with one being
     the default.

     If you use DDD with LessTif 0.92 or later, you can use any of the
     two LessTif versions.  If you use DDD with an older LessTif
     version, be sure to use the M*tif-1.2 compatible LessTif version.
     See `External Packages', below, for details.

     LessTif-0.93.40 is known to work well.

   * The X window library (Xlib) and X toolkit library (Xt), X11R4 or
     later.  Best results are obtained with X11R6.3 and later.

   * A `make' program.  We recommend GNU make.


We also recommend the following (optional) packages:

   * The XPM library (3.2 or later).  The XPM library brings support
     for multi-color icons and logos.  Without XPM, DDD will use
     monochrome icons.

   * The Athena Widget library (from X11R5 or later).  Having the
     Athena Widget library is convenient for supporting panners - a
     kind of two-dimensional scrollbar.


If (and only if) you make changes to the DDD sources, or if you build
DDD from a CVS archive, you may also need:

   * `automake' (after changes to Makefile templates)
   * `autoconf' (after changes to configuration files)
   * `bison' and `flex' (after changes to parser and scanner files)
   * `makeinfo' (after changes to documentation)
   * `netpbm' and `pbmplus' packages (after changes to icons)
   * `fig2dev' and ImageMagick `convert' (after changes to screenshots)
   * `texi2dvi' and LaTeX (for recreating the PostScript manual)
   * `epstopdf' and PDFLaTeX (for recreating the PDF manual)

The DDD source package contains several pre-build files, such that you
should not need any of these programs.  (If your `make' program
invokes any of the programs above on an unchanged source package, this
is a potential bug.  Find out what's going on and let us know; use GNU
make as a workaround.)


Execution Requirements
======================

To run DDD, you need:

   * An X server.  Without X, DDD does not run.

     If you are running a UNIX system, you certainly have X.  
     X servers are also available for other operating systems.  
     See `http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html' for a list.


   * A command-line debugger (the so-called `inferior' debugger).

     - To debug binary executables, best results are achieved with
       GDB, the GNU debugger.  (GDB 4.x is required; we recommend GDB
       5.0 or later.)  Using GDB, you can debug programs written in C,
       C++, GNU Java (`guavac'), GNU Ada (`gnat'), GNU Fortran (`g77'),
       GNU Chill and GNU Modula-2.

       GDB also supports WDB, a GDB variant found on HP-UX systems.

     - As an alternative to GDB, DDD also supports the DBX debugger as
       found on SUN, Compaq, DEC, AIX, and IRIX systems.  DDD adapts
       automatically to a wide range of DBX variants.

       Note: In DDD, GDB support is better than DBX support.  Try GDB first.

     - As an alternative to GDB, DDD also supports the `ladebug'
       debugger as found on some Compaq and DEC systems.  This is useful
       if you use a compiler that is better supported by `ladebug' than
       by GDB.

       Note: In DDD, GDB support is better than `ladebug' support.
       Try GDB first.

     - As another alternative, DDD also supports the XDB debugger as
       found on HP-UX systems.  XDB usage has been tested for C programs
       only, but may work for other languages as well.

       Note: In DDD, GDB support is much better than XDB support; in
       fact, XDB support is no longer maintained.  Try WDB or GDB 4.18
       or later; these support HP-UX compilers.

     - To debug Java bytecode programs, DDD supports JDB, the Java
       Debugger, as of JDK 1.1 and later.

       Please note: JDB is more a `proof of concept' than a real
       debugger.  DDD does its best to overcome JDB's limitations, but
       if you have an alternative to DDD/JDB, try it first.

     - To debug Python programs, DDD supports PYDB, a PDB extension.
       PYDB is included in the DDD distribution.

     - To debug Perl programs, DDD supports the Perl debugger as of
       Perl 5.003 and later.


The following recommended helper applications should be in the user path:

   * An X terminal emulator program (`xterm' or likewise).  DDD needs
     this for running programs in the separate execution window.

   * The GNU `info' program, version 4.0 or later,
     as well as various info files.

     - `info -f gdb' should show the GDB Manual.  DDD uses this to
       display the GDB Reference.

     - `info -f ddd' should show the DDD Manual (after installation).
       DDD uses this to display the DDD Manual.

     - `info -f libc' should show libc documentation.  DDD uses this
       give online help on the various signals.

   * The `xfontsel' font selection program.  With `xfontsel', you can
     select fonts interactively.

   * The `gnuplot' program, version 3.5 or later.  DDD uses `gnuplot'
     to plot array and history data.


Basic Installation
==================

Basically, to build and install DDD from sources, you enter three
commands:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the DDD
package.  It also creates some `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a
file `config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

If you need to do unusual things to compile the DDD package, please
try to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and
mail us diffs or instructions to so they can be considered for the next
release.  If at some point `config.cache' contains results you don't
want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile DDD is:

  1. See the DDD WWW page, `http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/',
     for recent release notes.

  2. See the file `PROBLEMS' for known problems during build and
     possible system-specific installation procedures.

  3. If you want to use DDD with LessTif, get a recent LessTif release
     from `http://www.lesstif.org' and see the local `patches/'
     subdirectory for patches to be applied.

  4. `cd' to the directory containing the DDD package source code
     (that is, the directory named `ddd-<release>', _not_ `ddd') and
     type
     
	$ ./configure
	
     to configure DDD for your system.  If you're using `csh' on an
     old version of System V, you might need to type

	% sh ./configure

     instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute `configure' itself.
     If you're building DDD on Windows using CYGWIN, type
     
	$ bash ./configure

     instead.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

     If `configure' reports an error or some bad result, check the
     files `config.log' and `ddd/config.log' for diagnostics.

  5. Check the `Makefile', `Ddd', and `config.h' files generated by
     `configure'.  Most settings should be guessed correctly by the
     `configure' program.  You may, however, wish to edit the
     settings, or re-run `configure' with special options.

     Frequently used `configure' options include `--program-prefix=x'
     to have DDD installed as `xddd' (to avoid confusion with existing
     `ddd' programs) or the `--with-motif...', `--with-athena...',
     `--with-x...'  options used to specify the locations of M*tif and
     Athena widgets or the X libraries.  These and other `configure'
     options are decribed below.

     If you have multiple library versions installed (for instance,
     multiple X11 releases or releases from different sources), you
     may also have to supply their locations.  See `Optional
     features', below.

  6. Now type
  
	$ make
	
     to build DDD.  Any modern MAKE flavors should do, but for
     incremental reconstruction, GNU MAKE is required on most
     systems.

  7. Building DDD takes awhile.  While DDD is being built, you may
     wish to read and/or print the documentation shipped with DDD.
     See the "Documentation" section, below.

  8. Check the `make' output for compiler errors and warnings.

     If you see any compiler errors or warnings, please see the
     sections `Warnings during build' and `Errors during build', below.

  9. For a simple check before installation, type
  
	$ make check
	
     This creates a sample C++ program `cxxtest' and then runs DDD
     on it by invoking `./ddd cxxtest'.  Enjoy!

     You can also invoke DDD directly, but DDD may not be able to
     locate its resources.  See Step 12, below, for appropriate
     settings.

 10. If DDD fails to start because a dynamic library is not found at
     runtime, re-run `configure' with the `--enable-rpath' option;
     see `Locating Libraries', below.  Delete ddd (`cd ddd; rm ddd')
     and repeat Steps 6--9.

 11. If DDD crashes immediately after startup or after a few
     interactions, first check your configuration (the output of
     `./ddd --configuration') for version mismatches.  Also check
     whether libraries and include files have matching versions.

     Then, see the `PROBLEMS' and `BUGS' files for known problems.  
     If the problem is not listed, report it to the DDD maintainers
     <bug-ddd@gnu.org>.  If you need help and assistance, see the DDD
     WWW page `http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/' for patches, people,
     and pointers.

 12. If you want to use DDD on your own program, please install it
     first (see the Step 13, below).  If you absolutely *must* run 
     DDD without installing it, be sure that the following environment
     variables are properly set:

     - DDD_HOME must point to the top-level source package directory
       (such that `$DDD_HOME/NEWS' is the DDD news)

     - XUSERFILESEARCHPATH must contain the path of the `Ddd'
       app-defaults file, where `Ddd' is substituted by `%N'.

     See the DDD invocation in `make check', above, to see typical
     values of these variables.

 13. Type
 
	$ make install
	
     This installs 
     - the DDD executable `ddd' in some public place 
       (usually in `/usr/local/bin/')
     - the DDD manual page `ddd.1' in `/usr/local/man/man1/'
     - the DDD info file `ddd.info' in `/usr/local/info/'
     - the DDD run-time resources into `/usr/local/share/ddd-VERSION/'.

     As an alternative, you can also type
 
	$ make install-strip

     instead.  This installs a `stripped' variant of the DDD
     executable; this saves space but prevents you from getting
     detailed diagnostics in case of DDD errors.

     See `Installation Names', below, on how to configure DDD to use
     other locations and names.

 14. This distribution also comes with documentation in PostScript,
     PDF, and HTML format.  You will find these files in the `doc/'
     subdirectory.  Feel free to install them in some public place.

 15. If you have a `Ddd' app-defaults file installed from a previous
     DDD version, this file will _override_ the DDD settings compiled 
     into DDD and cause major problems.  Remove it.

 16. Like every good X citizen, DDD comes with an application defaults
     file, named `ddd/Ddd'.  By default, this file is already installed as
     a DDD run-time resource (and possibly also compiled into DDD), so you
     need not install it in the default application defaults directory.

     In fact, we **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** not to install it; there is a
     whole slew of version-skew problems associated with app-defaults
     files, which are best avoided by simply not using them.  For
     details, see Step 15, above, and the comment at the `Ddd' top.

     If you absolutely want to install it (or if you configured DDD
     such that `Ddd' is not compiled into DDD), copy `Ddd' to a place
     where app-defaults files are commonly found.

 17. You can remove the program binaries, libraries and object files
     from the source directory by typing
     
	$ make clean

     (There is also `make mostlyclean', which removes all object
     files, but keeps the executables.)

     To also remove the Makefiles, the header files containing
     system-dependent definitions, and `config.status' (all the files
     that `configure' created), type
     
	$ make distclean

     (There is also `make maintainer-clean', which removes *each*
     derived file included in the DDD distribution - such as LEX and
     YACC output.  Do not use this unless you know what you're doing.)

 18. You can remove DDD from your system by typing
 
	$ make uninstall

     This undoes all effects of a previous `make install'.


Installation Details
====================

Compilers and Options
---------------------

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.
Using a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line
like this:

     CXX=/usr/egcs/bin/g++ CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:

     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Options set this way include:

`CC'
     The name of the C compiler

`CPPFLAGS'
     Preprocessing flags used by the C and C++ compilers

`CFLAGS'
     Compilation flags used by the C compiler

`CXX'
     The name of the C++ compiler

`CXXFLAGS'
     Compilation flags used by the C++ compiler

`LDFLAGS'
     Linker flags used by both the C and C++ compiler


Using a Different Build Directory
---------------------------------

You can compile the DDD package in a different directory from the one
containing the source code.  Doing so allows you to compile it on more
than one kind of computer at the same time.  To do this, you must use
a version of `make' that supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU
`make'.  `cd' to the directory where you want the object files and
executables to go and run the `configure' script.  `configure'
automatically checks for the source code in the directory that
`configure' is in and in `..'.


Installation Names
------------------

By default, `make install' will install the DDD files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

You can specify separate installation prefixes for architecture-
specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you give
`configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use PATH
as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.  Documentation
and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

You can cause DDD to be installed with an extra prefix or suffix on
its name by giving `configure' the option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or
`--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.


External Packages
-----------------

By default, `configure' will configure DDD to use all supported
external packages available on your system.

In some cases, `configure' may require additional information about
these packages:

   * `configure' can usually find the X include and library files
     automatically, but if it doesn't, you can use the `configure'
     options `--x-includes=DIR' and `--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their
     locations.  See also `Locating Libraries', below.
   
   * If `configure' doesn't find the M*tif include and library files
     automatically, you can use the `configure' options
     `--with-motif-includes=DIR' and `--with-motif-libraries=DIR' to
     specify their locations.  See also `Locating Libraries', below.
   
   * If `configure' doesn't find the Athena include and library files
     automatically, you can use the `configure' options
     `--with-athena-includes=DIR' and `--with-athena-libraries=DIR' to
     specify their locations.  See also `Locating Libraries', below.
   
   * If `configure' doesn't find the XPM include and library files
     automatically, you can use the `configure' options
     `--with-xpm-includes=DIR' and `--with-xpm-libraries=DIR' to specify
     their locations.  See also `Locating Libraries', below.
   
   * If `configure' doesn't find the Readline include and library files
     automatically, you can use the `configure' options
     `--with-readline-includes=DIR' and `--with-readline-libraries=DIR'
     to specify their locations.  See also `Locating Libraries', below.
   
   * If `configure' doesn't find the Ncurses include and library files
     automatically, you can use the `configure' options
     `--with-ncurses-includes=DIR' and `--with-ncurses-libraries=DIR'
     to specify their locations.  See also `Locating Libraries', below.


You can also configure DDD to _ignore_ some external packages:

   * If you wish to disable Athena widgets and rely on M*tif widgets alone,
     you can use the `configure' option `--without-athena'.
   
   * Likewise, `--without-xpm' disables XPM support.
   
   * There is also a `--without-motif' option.  Don't use it; DDD will
     not compile without M*tif.
   
   * If you wish to disable command-line editing on standard input,
     use `--without-readline'.



Locating Libraries
------------------

If one of the libraries to be used with DDD is a dynamic library and
installed in a non-standard place (that is, in a place where the
run-time linker cannot find it), you can specify its location
explicitly.

The option `--enable-rpath=PATH' sets the path of directories to be
searched for dynamic libraries to PATH (a colon-separated list of
directories).

For instance, if you have a LessTif library `libXm.so' installed in
`/you/cannot/find/me/' and a Readline library `libreadline.so'
installed in `/nobody/knows/i/am/here/', you can specify

    --enable-rpath=/you/cannot/find/me/:/nobody/knows/i/am/here/

to make sure these places are searched for libraries.

Note: `--enable-rpath' must be specified separately from
`--with-PACKAGE-libraries' and likewise because these are different
concepts:

   * `--with-PACKAGE-libraries' specifies the place to be searched at
     _link_ time;
   
   * `--enable-rpath' specifies the place to be searched at
     _execution_ time.




Optional Features
-----------------

By default, `configure' will configure DDD to use all supported
optional DDD features.  There are five optional features.

   * You can configure DDD such that the `Ddd' application defaults file
     will be compiled into the DDD executable.
   
     To enable the builtin application defaults file, use the `configure'
     option `--enable-builtin-app-defaults'.
   
   
   * You can configure DDD such that the DDD manual will be compiled into
     the DDD executable.
   
     To enable the builtin DDD manual, use the `configure' option
     `--enable-builtin-manual'.
   
   
   * You can configure DDD such that the DDD News will be compiled into
     the DDD executable.
   
     To enable the builtin DDD news, use the `configure' option
     `--enable-builtin-news'.
   
   
   * You can configure DDD such that the DDD License will be compiled into
     the DDD executable.
   
     To enable the builtin DDD news, use the `configure' option
     `--enable-builtin-license'.
   
   
   * You can configure DDD such that the DDD VSL library `ddd.vsl' will
     be compiled into the DDD executable.
   
     To enable the builtin VSL library, use the `configure' option
     `--enable-builtin-vsllib'.

See also `External Packages', above, to disable external packages such
as the Readline library used for command-line editing on standard input.




Specifying the System Type
--------------------------

There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host DDD will run
on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.


Sharing Defaults
----------------

If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.


Operation Controls
------------------

`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Save the results of the tests in FILE instead of `config.cache'.
     Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for debugging
     `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the DDD source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.



Warnings during build
---------------------

Normally, DDD should build without any warnings.  If you encounter
warnings, these may indicate actual problems in DDD code, showing up
in your particular configuration.

Warnings that can be ignored safely include warnings about code
not being reached and warnings about unused, uninitialized, or
shadowed variables.

However, GCC warnings that *must never be ignored* include:

   * `implicit declaration of function F'
   * `cannot pass objects of type T through `...''

If you encounter such a warning, GCC will generate unusable code.
Abort compilation and fix the problem.

If you find the warning can be avoided by changing some code or by
changing the DDD build process, please send a bug report to the DDD
maintainers <bug-ddd@gnu.org>.  Be sure to include a context
diff (`diff -c2') between the original and the changed file(s).



Errors during build
-------------------

Normally, DDD should build without any errors.  If you encounter
errors, these indicate serious problems in either DDD code or your
particular configuration.

The `PROBLEMS' file contains a number of common problems encountered
during build, as well as fixes and workarounds.  If the problem is not
listed there, please ask a local expert for help.

If you find the error can be avoided by changing some DDD code or by
changing the DDD build process, please send a bug report to the DDD
maintainers <bug-ddd@gnu.org>.  Be sure to include a context
diff (`diff -c2') between the original and the changed file(s).


Documentation
=============

The DDD Manual, contained in the file `ddd/ddd.texi', is the official
DDD reference.  

Preformatted versions of the DDD Manual (in info, PostScript, and PDF
formats) can be found in the `doc/' subdirectory.  A HTML version
comes in a separate package.  Note that DDD also has various on-line
facilities.
