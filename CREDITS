DDD Credits							-*- text -*-
***********

   A big smile and thanks should go to all the folks who cheered us up
during the long hours of programming.  Sorry, folks, but we cannot
help including the list below of comments we've got.  (Actually, most
of these comments are taken from bug reports, so your mileage may
vary).  If you really like DDD, do not forget to send us a picture
postcard, or leave a message in the DDD guestbook (accessible via the
DDD WWW page, `http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/').

rms@gnu.ai.mit.edu (Richard Stallman):

    This does sound good.  If you convert DDD to work with other
    widgets, and assuming DDD is cleanly written and can be cleanly
    merged into GDB, I would definitely like to see that happen.

shebs@cygnus.com (Stan Shebs):

    Hi, I'm currently maintaining GDB for the FSF.  We took a look at
    DDD and were very impressed!  In fact, we noticed that it made a
    good test for regression in G++; our current G++ version wouldn't
    compile DDD, and we had to fix it.

rossmann@penthesilea.uni-trier.de (Jan Rossmann):

    ... wonderful tool, from what I saw by now ...

jcrupi@mystech.com (John Crupi):

    I would just like to tell that I am extremely impressed with ddd.
    I am an dedicated gdb user and have been looking for a gui front
    end for quite a while.

baird@asc.on.ca (Warren Baird):

    Thank you for creating such an excellent debugger.  I've used it
    briefly on one of our non-SGI machines, and it looks like it will be
    very useful.  I look forward to getting it ported to the SGI.

darryl@chc.bpss.eds.com (Darryl House):

    Thank you for providing a much-needed product.

Herve.Poirier@xerox.fr (Herve Poirier):

    DDD seems a very good debugger.

hannu@cctap.carel.fi (Hannu Mallat):

    Looks like debugging could be fun with it!

taob@gate.sinica.edu.tw (Brian Tao):

    Clicked around in the source window, followed functions
    around, created a few data displays, etc. (very neat!).

glenn@mathcs.emory.edu (Glenn Barry):

    thx for a very cool debugger!

ric@coronacorp.com (Ric Steinberger):

    DDD is great!

ross@wanda.mecalc.co.za (Ross Linder):

    Great work, its really nice to see some OSF/Motif Compliant
    products.

dmike@CS.HUJI.AC.IL (Michael Dorfman):

    Thanks for the best debugger!

vickery@babbage.cs.qc.edu (Christopher Vickery):

    This package is really great.  The Free Software Foundation and
    the Unix community at large should award you a medal for what ddd
    is going to do for the gdb community.  Thank You!

smcarey@mailbox.syr.edu (Shawn M. Carey):

    First, let me say thanks for making what has to be the nicest
    debugger for X I have seen!  ddd is really a class act, and I'll
    be sending you a postcard soon.

weber@gabor.ece.cmu.edu (Dave Weber):

    This is a really nice product with a nice, clean look and feel. I
    have used xxgdb and I prefer ddd.  I look forward to working with
    ddd in the future.

jck@catt.citri.edu.au (Justin Kibell):

    Just a short note of thanks for the wonderful debugger you have
    created. I use it quite a lot now and find it very useful. Keep up
    the good work.

aisic@ksl.co.il (Ilan Aisic)

    I tried it on a huge program that we're developing here and was
    very impressed (the ups debugger core dumps on it).
    I've installed it for all our SunOS systems and became a fan!
    I've told all the other developers in here about ddd by email and
    later today when I'm supposed to give a talk about a different
    issue, I'll hand them all a copy of doc/ddd-paper.ps. [...]
    Regards, and thanks for writing such a nice GUI for gdb.
