DDD Credits							-*- text -*-
***********

   A big smile and thanks should go to all the folks who cheered us up
during the long hours of programming.  Sorry, folks, but we cannot help
including the list below of comments we've got.  (Actually, most of
these comments are taken from bug reports, so your mileage may vary).
If you really like DDD, do not forget to send us a picture postcard.

rossmann@penthesilea.uni-trier.de (Jan Rossmann):

    ... wonderful tool, from what I saw by now ...

jcrupi@mystech.com (John Crupi):

    I would just like to tell that I am extremely impressed with ddd.
    I am an dedicated gdb user and have been looking for a gui front
    end for quite a while.

baird@asc.on.ca (Warren Baird):

    Thank you for creating such an excellent debugger.  I've used it
    briefly on one of our non-SGI machines, and it looks like it will be
    very useful.  I look forward to getting it ported to the SGI.

darryl@chc.bpss.eds.com (Darryl House):

    Thank you for providing a much-needed product.

Herve.Poirier@xerox.fr (Herve Poirier):

    DDD seems a very good debugger.

hannu@cctap.carel.fi (Hannu Mallat):

    Looks like debugging could be fun with it!

taob@gate.sinica.edu.tw (Brian Tao):

    Clicked around in the source window, followed functions
    around, created a few data displays, etc. (very neat!).

glenn@mathcs.emory.edu (Glenn Barry):

    thx for a very cool debugger!

ric@coronacorp.com (Ric Steinberger):

    DDD is great!

ross@wanda.mecalc.co.za (Ross Linder):

    Great work, its really nice to see some OSF/Motif Compliant
    products.

dmike@CS.HUJI.AC.IL (Michael Dorfman):

    Thanks for the best debugger!

vickery@babbage.cs.qc.edu (Christopher Vickery):

    This package is really great.  The Free Software Foundation and
    the Unix community at large should award you a medal for what ddd
    is going to do for the gdb community.  Thank You!

smcarey@mailbox.syr.edu (Shawn M. Carey):

    First, let me say thanks for making what has to be the nicest
    debugger for X I have seen!  ddd is really a class act, and I'll
    be sending you a postcard soon.

weber@gabor.ece.cmu.edu (Dave Weber):

    This is a really nice product with a nice, clean look and feel. I
    have used xxgdb and I prefer ddd.  I look forward to working with
    ddd in the future.
