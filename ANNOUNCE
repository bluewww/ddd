DDD News
========

    DDD 2.0 brings XDB support, extended DBX support, an improved user
    interface as well as several new features and bug fixes.

    User-visible changes to DDD 1.4:
    - New command tool.  All command buttons that do not take
      arguments are now located in the command tool, a small separate
      window.  The command tool can be moved wherever appropriate,
      leaving more space for window contents.
    - User-defined buttons are now available.  These can also
      be used to re-install the old command buttons.
    - Colored displays.  You can specify individual colors for
      pointers, arrays, structs, and so on.
    - Variable values can now be altered interactively during program
      execution.
    - You can inquire the types of variables and functions (`whatis') 
      through the source popup menu.
    - Selecting a data display item now also sets the `()' argument field
      in the source window, making it available for further commands.
    - `New display' subsumes `Dependent display': if a display is
      selected, the new display is made dependent on it.
    - `Show Detail' expands the entire selected value, including all
      contained sub-structures.
    - Option editors.  New panels for DDD preferences and GDB
      settings.  GDB settings can be saved across DDD sessions.
    - Some items have been renamed for further clarity:
      * The `command window' is now named `debugger console', to avoid
        confusion with the command tool.
      * The `Interrupt' button is now named `Break', to associate the
	concept with `Breakpoints'.
      * The `Break ()' and `Clear ()' buttons are now named `Break at ()'
        and `Clear at ()', respectively.
      * The `Dereference' button is now named `Display *'.
    - DDD now supports GDB-like incremental search in the command history.
      It is invoked through Ctrl+R and Ctrl+S in the debugger console.
    - Incremental search required some changes in keyboard shortcuts.
      `Run' is now Ctrl+Z, `Step' is Ctrl+I, and `Next' is Ctrl+J.
    - The `Save Options on Exit' function has been removed, as it
      also saved options given upon DDD invocation like `--dbx' or
      `--exec-window'.  Options must now always be saved explicitly.
    - You can press Ctrl+\ to interrupt programs using a QUIT signal.
    - Ctrl+C and Ctrl+\ now have the highest priority of all events.
    - Improved remote debugging.  In contrast to `--host', the new
      `--rhost' option uses `rsh' without arguments (aka `rlogin') 
      to access the remote debugger.  DEC and SGI DBX require this.
    - The DDD License can now be viewed from within DDD.
    - DDD resources and actions are now fully documented; the DDD manual
      contains several customization examples (fonts, colors, buttons).

    Supported debuggers and languages:
    - XDB support.  On popular request, DDD now also supports HP's XDB as
      inferior debugger.
    - Extended DBX support.  DDD determines DBX properties
      at run-time and adapts automatically to a wide range of DBX
      variants.
    - Even more DBX support.  DDD now supports DBX on SUN, DEC, AIX,
      and IRIX systems.
    - Language support.  DDD uses Pascal-style dereferencing (X^ 
      instead of *X) if the current frame was written in Pascal, Ada,
      or Modula.  (GDB only)
    - Modula-3 support.  DDD supports `m3gdb', a GDB extension for Modula-3.
      Thanks to Peter Klein <pk@i3.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>.

    Changes in configuration and building:
    - New top-level `configure' script.  DDD now uses an `autoconf'-
      generated top-level `configure' script instead of Cygnus
      `configure'.  Among other advantages, configuration options are
      now properly passed down to subdirectory configuration.
    - Regular expressions now use the POSIX.2 standard regcomp/regexec
      interface.  The slower interface is compensated by smarter calls.
    - DDD configuration now generally attempts to link with native system
      libraries wherever possible.  GNU termcap and librx are used
      only if the system does not provide them.  This results in
      smaller and (hopefully) safer DDD executables.
    - DDD configuration tests whether your C++ compiler can compile a
      `hello, world' program.  It is amazing how many misconfigured
      C++ compilers exist in the world.
    - You can specify `--without-athena' to avoid searching for and
      linking with Athena libraries.
    - Patches for AIX xlC, Sun CC, GCC 2.8.0 and probably other 
      C++ compilers included.  Thanks to Jacek Holeczek
      <holeczek@clri6f.gsi.de> and Jason Merrill <jason@cygnus.com>.
    - DDD now compiles and runs unchanged with LessTif, a free Motif
      clone under construction.  Note that `runs' is relative: As of
      LessTif 0.50, DDD is still far from being usable.  This will
      change as LessTif evolves.

    Bug fixes:
    - Improved directory support.  Sources and executables can reside
      in several different directories.  With DBX and XDB, DDD
      optionally uses full file paths when referring to source positions.
    - Several TTY problems fixed.  Switching between execution window 
      and debugger console should work fine now; the execution window
      can be opened, closed and re-opened without DDD crashing or
      hanging.
    - The terminal type (TERM environment variable) of the debugger
      console and the execution window is now properly set.
    - Editor problems fixed.  Invoking a source editor via `Edit'
      should work fine now.
    - The rubber band outline no more clutters the data display.
      (This was a GCC optimization bug.)
    - No more endless scrolling when glyphs are enabled.  Scrolling is
      slightly faster, too.
    - On HP-UX, the `@' character is no more discarded from GDB input.
    - On Solaris 2.x, annoying DBX warnings like `dbx: -r option only
      recognized for C++' are silently ignored.
    - You can now specify the location of own VSL libraries via the
      `vslPath' resource.
    - Improved diagnostics (file names and line numbers) for VSL errors.
    - The `--attach' and `--separate' options are no more overridden
      by the settings in `~/.dddinit'.
    - The `-synchronous' option (for X debugging) now works;
      `--synchronous-debugger' has been renamed to `--sync-debugger'.
    - The source window no more scrolls back to some previous position
      when adding or removing breakpoints.
    - Pagers (`more', `less', etc.) invoked by the inferior debugger
      are properly handled.  (When seeing `--More--', DDD hits the
      space key.)
    - And, of course, hundreds of minor bug fixes and improvements.


Summary of DDD
==============

    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a common graphical user
    interface to GDB, DBX, and XDB, the popular UNIX debuggers.
    Besides ``usual'' features such as viewing source texts and
    breakpoints, DDD provides a graphical data display, where data
    structures are displayed as graphs.  A simple mouse click
    dereferences pointers or reveals structure contents, updated each
    time the program stops.  Using DDD, you can reason about your
    application by viewing its data, not just by viewing it execute
    lines of source code.

    Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in C,
    C++, Ada, Fortran, Pascal, Modula-2, or Modula-3; machine-level
    debugging; hypertext source navigation and lookup; breakpoint,
    backtrace, and history editors; preferences and settings editors;
    program execution in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote
    host; on-line manual; interactive help on the OSF/Motif user
    interface; GDB/DBX/XDB command-line interface with full editing,
    history, and completion capabilities.  DDD has been designed to
    compete with well-known commercial debuggers.

    DDD has been extensively beta-tested (especially by debugging
    itself) and configures, compiles and runs out-of-the-box on every
    major UNIX brand, including AIX (powerpc-ibm-aix3,
    rs6000-ibm-aix3), FreeBSD (i386-intel-freebsd1), HP-UX
    (hppa1.1-hp-hpux9, m68k-hp-hpux9), IRIX (mips-sgi-irix5), Linux
    (i[345]86-unknown-linux, i[345]86-unknown-linuxaout), Alpha OSF
    (alpha-osf3), Solaris (i386-sun-solaris2, sparc-sun-solaris2),
    SunOS (sparc-sun-sunos4), and ULTRIX (mips-dec-ultrix4).

    DDD is free software, protected by the GNU general public license.
    It is actively maintained by its authors, Dorothea Luetkehaus and
    Andreas Zeller at the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig,
    Germany.



Requirements
============

    To build a complete DDD from sources, you need:

       * The GNU C++ compiler (GCC/G++), preferably version 2.6.3 or
	 later, and a matching C++ I/O library (libstdc++ or libg++).

         Some other C++ compilers have been reported to compile DDD as
         well, such as Sun CC 4.0, AIX xlC and SGI CC.  Cfront 3.0
         does not compile DDD.  On SGI, GCC usage is preferred.

       * The X window library (Xlib) and X toolkit library (Xt),
         X11R4 or later.

       * The OSF/Motif Widget library (release 1.1 or later).  Best
         results are achieved using Motif 2.0 in conjunction with the
         Athena Widget library.

	 DDD also compiles with LessTif, a free Motif clone.  But as
	 of LessTif 0.50, the resulting DDD executable is far from
	 being usable.  This will change as LessTif evolves.

       * Optionally, in addition to the OSF/Motif widget library, the
         Athena Widget library (release 5 or later).  Having the
         Athena Widget library is convenient for supporting
         two-dimensional scrollbars and the `editres' protocol.

       * Lots of virtual memory.

    To run DDD, you need an inferior command-line debugger.  Best
    results are achieved with GDB, the GNU debugger.  (GDB 4.x is
    required; best results are achieved with GDB 4.13 or later.)
    Using GDB, you can debug programs written in C and C++; GNU Ada
    (`gnat'), GNU Fortran (`g77') and GNU Modula-2 have been reported
    to work as well.

    As an alternative to GDB, DDD also supports the DBX debugger as
    found on SUN, DEC, AIX, and IRIX systems.  Using DBX, you can
    debug programs written in C, C++, Pascal, Fortran, and Modula-2.
    DDD adapts automatically to a wide range of other DBX variants.

    As another alternative, DDD also supports the XDB debugger as
    found on HP-UX systems.  XDB usage has been tested for C programs
    only, but may work for other languages as well.



More Information
================

    The DDD World-Wide-Web page (including screen shots) is installed at

        http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/

    A short DDD survey with several screen shots is available at

        ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/ddd-paper.ps.gz

    The six-page paper gives a short introduction to the look-and-feel
    of DDD and highlights some internal aspects.

    The DDD users mailing list, 

        ddd-users@ips.cs.tu-bs.de

    is the right place to contact other DDD users for assistance and
    hints.  New DDD releases are also announced here.  For more
    information on this list, and for subscription, send a mail to

        ddd-users-request@ips.cs.tu-bs.de

    Please send suggestions and bug reports for DDD to

        ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de

    As the DDD developers are often busy with other projects, don't
    expect an immediate personal answer.  We try to resolve and fix
    all reported bugs as soon as possible.


DDD source FTP sites
====================

    The DDD source package `ddd-2.0.tar.gz' will soon be at these FTP
    sites as well.  Please try them before `ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de' since
    ftp.ips has a slow network connection.

DDD full FTP sites
==================

    Besides DDD source packages, the sites listed here also carry DDD
    binaries and patches as well as formatted DDD documentation and
    DDD-related papers.

    DDD pre-compiled binaries have been contributed for a variety of
    architectures.  This may be useful for people who lack GCC or
    Motif.  However, compiling DDD on your machine is strongly
    preferred.  Use binaries as a last resort only.

    The `bin/README' file contains a list of available binaries.
    Additional contributions are very welcome.
