DDD News
========


    DDD 1.5 brings XDB support, extended DBX support, an improved user
    interface and many bug fixes.

    User-visible changes to DDD 1.4:
    - XDB support.  On popular request, DDD now supports HP's XDB debugger.
    - DBX is now also supported on DEC and AIX systems.
    - Improved general DBX support.  DDD determines DBX properties
      at run-time and adapts automatically to a wide range of DBX
      variants.
    - New command tool.  All command buttons that do not take
      arguments are now located in the command tool, a small separate
      window.  The command tool can be moved wherever appropriate,
      leaving more space for window contents.
    - User-defined buttons are now available.  These can also
      be used to re-install the DDD 1.4 command buttons.
    - Improved directory support.  Sources and executables can reside
      in several different directories.
    - Changing the current directory (`cd') is now supported.
      File selection dialogs are synchronized with the current
      directory.
    - Variable values can now be altered interactively during program
      execution.
    - `New display' subsumes `Dependent display': if a display is
      selected, the new display is made dependent on it.
    - A couple of buttons have been renamed for further clarity.

    Changes in configuration and building:
    - Regular expressions now use the POSIX.2 standard regcomp/regexec
      interface.  The slower interface is compensated by smarter calls.
    - DDD configuration now generally attempts to link with native system
      libraries wherever possible.  GNU termcap and librx are used
      only if the system does not provide them.  This results in
      smaller and (hopefully) safer DDD executables.
    - Patches for AIX xlC C++ compiler (and probably others) included.
      Thanks to Jacek Holeczek <holeczek@clri6f.gsi.de>.

    Several bug fixes, including:
    - The execution window can be opened, closed and re-opened
      without DDD crashing or hanging.
    - Invoking a source editor via `Edit' should work fine now.
    - The rubber band outline no more clutters the data display.
    - On HP-UX, the `@' character is no more discarded from GDB input.
    - On Solaris 2.x, annoying DBX warnings like `dbx: -r option only
      recognized for C++' are silently ignored.
    - The `vslPath' resource now works.


Summary of DDD
==============

    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a comfortable graphical user
    interface to GDB, DBX, and XDB, the popular UNIX debuggers.
    Besides ``usual'' features such as viewing source texts and
    breakpoints, DDD provides a *graphical data display*, where data
    structures are displayed as graphs.  A simple mouse click
    dereferences pointers or reveals structure contents.  Complex data
    structures can be explored incrementally and interactively, using
    automatic layout if preferred.  Each time the program stops, the
    data display reflects the current variable values.  Using DDD, you
    can reason about your application by viewing its data, not just by
    viewing it execute lines of source code.

    Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in C,
    C++, Ada, Fortran, Pascal, or Modula-2; machine-level debugging;
    hypertext source navigation and lookup; GDB/DBX/XDB command-line
    interface with full editing, history, and completion capabilities;
    breakpoint, backtrace, and history editors; optional program
    execution in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote host;
    on-line manual; interactive help on the OSF/Motif user interface.
    DDD has been designed to compete with well-known commercial
    debuggers.

    DDD has been extensively beta-tested (especially by debugging
    itself) and configures, compiles and runs out-of-the-box on every
    major UNIX brand, including AIX (powerpc-ibm-aix3,
    rs6000-ibm-aix3), FreeBSD (i386-intel-freebsd1), HP-UX
    (hppa1.1-hp-hpux9, m68k-hp-hpux9), IRIX (mips-sgi-irix5), Linux
    (i[345]86-unknown-linux, i[345]86-unknown-linuxaout), Alpha OSF
    (alpha-osf3), Solaris (i386-sun-solaris2, sparc-sun-solaris2),
    SunOS (sparc-sun-sunos4), and ULTRIX (mips-dec-ultrix4).

    DDD is free software, protected by the GNU general public license.
    It is actively maintained by its authors, Dorothea Luetkehaus and
    Andreas Zeller at the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig,
    Germany.



Requirements
============

    To build a complete DDD from sources, you need:

    * The GNU C++ compiler (GCC/G++, preferably release 2.6.3 or
      later), and a matching C++ I/O library (libg++, libstdc++, or
      libiostream).

      Some other C++ compilers have been reported to compile DDD as
      well, such as Sun CC 4.0 or AIX xlC.  Cfront 3.0 does not
      compile DDD.

    * The X window library (Xlib) and X toolkit library (Xt), X11R4 or
      later.

    * The OSF/Motif Widget library (release 1.1 or later).  Best
      results are achieved using Motif 2.0 in conjunction with the
      Athena Widget library.

    * Optionally, in addition to the OSF/Motif widget library, the
      Athena Widget library (release 5 or later).  Having the Athena
      Widget library is convenient for supporting two-dimensional
      scrollbars and the `editres' protocol.

    * Lots of virtual memory.

    To run DDD, you need an underlying command-line debugger.  Best
    results are achieved with GDB, the GNU debugger.  (GDB 4.x is
    required; best results are achieved with GDB 4.13 or later.)
    Using GDB, you can debug programs written in C and C++; GNU Ada
    (`gnat'), GNU Fortran (`g77') and GNU Modula-2 have been reported
    to work as well.

    As an alternative, DDD also supports the DBX debugger as found on
    SUN and DEC systems.  Using DBX, you can debug programs written in
    C, C++, Pascal and Modula-2.  DBX usage has been reported to work
    on other systems as well, notably AIX.  DDD adapts itself to a
    wide range of DBX variants.

    As another alternative, DDD also supports the XDB debugger as
    found on HP-UX systems.  XDB usage has been tested for C programs
    only, but may work for other languages as well.


More Information
================

    A World-Wide-Web page (including screen shots) devoted to DDD is
    installed at

        http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/

    A short DDD survey with several screen shots is available at

        ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/ddd-paper.ps.gz

    The six-page paper gives a short introduction to the
    ``look-and-feel'' of DDD and highlights some internal aspects.

    The DDD users mailing list, `ddd-users@ips.cs.tu-bs.de', is the
    right place to contact other DDD users for assistance and hints.
    New DDD releases and bug fixes are also announced here.  Send a
    mail to `ddd-users-request@ips.cs.tu-bs.de' for more information
    on this list and how to subscribe.

    Some people and organizations offer support services for DDD.  See
    the file `SERVICE' in the DDD distribution for details.

    Send suggestions and bug reports for DDD to `ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de'.



DDD source FTP sites
====================

    The DDD source package `ddd-1.5.tar.gz' will soon be at these FTP
    sites as well.  Please try them before `ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de' since
    ftp.ips has a slow network connection.

DDD full FTP sites
==================

    Besides DDD source packages, the sites listed here also carry DDD
    binaries and patches as well as formatted DDD documentation and
    DDD-related papers.

    DDD pre-compiled binaries are available for a variety of
    architectures.  This may be useful for people who lack GCC or Motif.
    However, compiling DDD on your machine is strongly preferred.  Use
    binaries as a last resort only.

    The `bin/README' file contains a list of available binaries.
    Additional contributions are very welcome.
