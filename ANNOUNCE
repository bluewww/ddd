What's new in DDD?
==================

    DDD 3.0 brings a new window layout, Java support, and JDB support.

    User-visible changes to DDD 2.2.3:
    - New look.  The DDD 2.x button rows are replaced by an icon
      toolbar at the top, saving vertical and horizontal space.
    - Configurable fonts.  You can easily customize font families and
      font sizes using just a few resources;, `ddd --fontsize 120'
      starts DDD with 12-point fonts.  See `Setting DDD fonts' in the
      DDD manual for details.
    - JDB support.  DDD now also supports JDB as inferior debugger.
      All important JDB features are available via the GUI.
    - Java support.  Requires GDB 4.17 or later (or JDB, of course).
      All data display features are available in Java.
    - Watchpoints.  You can have the debugged program stop
      automatically whenever a particular variable is read or written.
    - Deferred displays.  DDD now can maintain displays whose creation
      is deferred until a particular scope is entered.  Benefits:
      * Displays are now persistent across recompilations.
      * In sessions, displays can also be restored without core dump.
    - Tear-off menus are supported (and enabled by default).
    - Breakpoint properties.  There is an editor panel to set and
      change all properties for a breakpoint at once.
    - Breakpoint commands.  You can record and edit commands to be
      executed when a breakpoint is reached.
    - On popular demand, the command tool now has `until' and `make' buttons.
    - Conditional breakpoints and breakpoints with ignore counts are now
      indicated by special breakpoint symbols.
    - When detecting a grabbed (frozen) mouse pointer after reaching a
      breakpoint, DDD now automatically continues execution, rather
      than attempting to ungrab the pointer.
    - Improved help system: In accordance with the Motif style guide,
      F1 invokes help on the item pointed at, while Shift+F1 lets you
      choose an item.
    - Tips of the day.  Upon startup, DDD shows a useful hint for DDD usage.
    - Value tips and selections now work for struct members, too: you
      can point at `A.B' or `A->B' and get the current value.
    - The maximum number of glyphs is now configurable at startup time.
      See the `maxGlyphs' resource for details.
    - DDD no longer indents the source code, leaving more horizontal
      space.  To change this, see `Edit | Preferences | Source |
      Source indentation'.
    - DBX settings now also work with SGI DBX.

    Bug fixes:
    - Data displays are no longer cluttered by Sun DBX 3.0 warnings.
    - Paned window management has been improved a lot.
    - DDD now works around a Motif 2.1/XFree86 bug that caused glyphs
      to disappear.  See the `cacheGlyphImages' resource for details.
    - The `endless scrolling' problem may now be prevented by delaying
      glyph updates.  See the `glyphUpdateDelay' resource for details.
    - DDD no longer terminates the inferior debugger when receiving an 
      EOF on input.   See the `terminateOnEOF' resource for details.
    - The new grab detection mechanism no longer interferes with grabs
      on Motif popup and pulldown menus.
    - One-letter options like `-b BPS' or `-x FILE' work again.

    Changes in configuration and building:
    - LessTif 0.83 is supported (and a standard test environment of
      the DDD developers).  See `patches/' for some useful patches.

    Compatibility notes:
    - Some resources were renamed for clarity:
      The `toolBar' resource is now named `commandToolBar'.
      The `colorIcons' resource is now named `colorWMIcons'.
      Please rename all references to these DDD resources.
    - To enable a DDD 2.x style window layout, use

	Ddd*commonToolBar:    off
	Ddd*toolbarsAtBottom: on

      in your `~/.ddd/init' file.  For a full DDD 2.x look, disable images
      and captions via `Edit | Preferences | Startup | Toolbar Appareance'.

    And once more, several more minor improvements and bug fixes; see
    the `ChangeLog' file for details.


What is DDD, anyway?
====================

    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a popular graphical user
    interface to UNIX debuggers such as GDB, DBX, XDB, and JDB.
    Besides ``usual'' front-end features such as viewing source texts
    and breakpoints, DDD got famous for its interactive graphical data
    display, where data structures are displayed as graphs.  Using
    DDD, you can reason about your application by watching its data,
    not just by viewing it execute lines of source code.

    Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in Ada,
    C, C++, Chill, Fortran, Java, Modula, and Pascal; machine-level
    debugging; hypertext source navigation and lookup; breakpoint,
    backtrace, and history editors; preferences and settings editors;
    program execution in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote
    host; on-line manual; interactive help on the Motif user
    interface; command-line interface with full editing, history, and
    completion capabilities.  DDD has been designed to compete with
    well-known commercial debuggers and is being used for software
    development by all major suppliers of information technology.

    Speaking of platforms: DDD configures, compiles and runs
    out-of-the-box on all major UNIX platforms, including
    hppa1.1-hp-hpux, i386-pc-linux, i386-pc-sco, i386-pc-solaris,
    i386-unknown-freebsd, i386-unknown-netbsd, i386-univel-sysv.
    m68k-hp-hpux, mips-dec-ultrix, mips-sgi-irix, powerpc-ibm-aix,
    rs6000-ibm-aix, sparc-sun-solaris, and sparc-sun-sunos.

    DDD is free software, protected by the GNU general public license.
    It is actively maintained by its co-author, Andreas Zeller at the
    Technische Universitaet Braunschweig, Germany.


What do I need to build DDD?
============================

    To build a complete DDD from sources, you need:

       * The GNU C++ compiler (2.7.2 or later), including a matching
         C++ I/O runtime library (libstdc++ or libg++).

         Some other C++ compilers have been reported to compile DDD as
         well.  Good results have been reported with Sun CC 4.0.  SGI
         CC and AIX xlC compile DDD, but introduce some subtle errors.
         Cfront 3.0 does not compile DDD.  In doubt, GCC is preferred.

       * A Motif Widget library, either LessTif (0.83 or later) or
         OSF/Motif (1.1 or later).  See the DDD WWW site and the
         `patches/' directory for useful LessTif patches.  LessTif is
         available via `http://www.lesstif.org/'.

       * The X window library (Xlib) and X toolkit library (Xt), X11R4
         or later.


    The following packages are recommended, but not required:

       * The Athena Widget library (from X11R5 or later).  Having the
         Athena Widget library is convenient for supporting
         two-dimensional scrollbars and the `editres' protocol.

       * The XPM library (3.2 or later).  The XPM library brings
         support for multi-color icons and logos.


    To run DDD, you need an inferior command-line debugger.  Best
    results are achieved with GDB, the GNU debugger.  (GDB 4.x is
    required; best results are achieved with GDB 4.13 or later.)
    Using GDB, you can debug programs written in C, C++, GNU Java
    (`guavac'), GNU Ada (`gnat'), GNU Fortran (`g77') and GNU Modula-2.

    As an alternative to GDB, DDD also supports the DBX debugger as
    found on SUN, DEC, AIX, and IRIX systems.  Using DBX, you can
    debug programs written in C, C++, Pascal, Fortran, and Modula-2.
    DDD adapts automatically to a wide range of other DBX variants.

    As another alternative, DDD also supports the XDB debugger as
    found on HP-UX systems.  XDB usage has been tested for C programs
    only, but may work for other languages as well.

    Finally, DDD also supports JDB, the Java Debugger, as of JDK 1.1
    and later.  Using JDB, you can find and fix bugs in Java programs.


Where do I get more information?
================================

    The DDD WWW page (including screen shots) is available at

        http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/

    A short DDD survey with several screen shots is available at

        ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/ddd-paper.ps.gz

    The six-page paper gives a short introduction to the look-and-feel
    of DDD and highlights some internal aspects.

    The DDD manual is the official, up-to-date DDD reference.  It now
    includes more than 40 screen shots.  It is available at

        ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/doc/

    The DDD users mailing list, 

        ddd-users@ips.cs.tu-bs.de

    is the right place to contact other DDD users for assistance and
    hints.  New DDD releases are also announced here.  For more
    information on this list, and for subscription, send a mail to

        ddd-users-request@ips.cs.tu-bs.de

    Please send suggestions and bug reports for DDD to

        ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de

    As the DDD developers are usually busy with other projects, don't
    expect an immediate personal answer.  However, all bug reports are 
    read and considered for the next DDD release.
