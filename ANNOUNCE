DDD 2.1.1 is available					-*- text -*-
======================

    Release 2.1.1 of the Data Display Debugger (DDD), a common graphical
    front-end for GDB, DBX, and XDB debuggers, is now available at

        ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/ddd-2.1.1.tar.gz

What's new in DDD?
==================

    DDD 2.1.1 no more needs OSF/Motif.  It also compiles and runs with
    LessTif, a free Motif clone, release 0.79 or later, without loss
    of functionality.

    Apart from these hacks, functionality is unchanged with respect to
    DDD 2.1 (no new features, no bug fixes).  If you have DDD 2.1 up
    and running, there is no need to upgrade to DDD 2.1.1.

    DDD 2.1.1 also includes all the new features and bug fixes of DDD
    2.1, including alias detection, local variable displays, as well
    as button and value tips.


What is DDD, anyway?
====================

    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a common graphical user
    interface to GDB, DBX, and XDB, the popular UNIX debuggers.
    Besides ``usual'' features such as viewing source texts and
    breakpoints, DDD provides a graphical data display, where data
    structures are displayed as graphs.  A simple mouse click
    dereferences pointers or reveals structure contents, updated each
    time the program stops.  Using DDD, you can reason about your
    application by viewing its data, not just by viewing it execute
    lines of source code.

    Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in C,
    C++, Ada, Fortran, Pascal, Modula-2, or Modula-3; machine-level
    debugging; hypertext source navigation and lookup; breakpoint,
    backtrace, and history editors; preferences and settings editors;
    program execution in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote
    host; on-line manual; interactive help on the Motif user
    interface; GDB/DBX/XDB command-line interface with full editing,
    history, and completion capabilities.  DDD has been designed to
    compete with well-known commercial debuggers.
    
    Speaking of platforms: DDD configures, compiles and runs
    out-of-the-box on every major UNIX platform, including AIX
    (powerpc-ibm-aix3, rs6000-ibm-aix3), FreeBSD
    (i386-intel-freebsd1), HP-UX (hppa1.1-hp-hpux9, m68k-hp-hpux9),
    IRIX (mips-sgi-irix5), Linux (i[345]86-unknown-linux,
    i[345]86-unknown-linuxaout), Alpha OSF (alpha-osf3), Solaris
    (i386-sun-solaris2, sparc-sun-solaris2), SunOS (sparc-sun-sunos4),
    and ULTRIX (mips-dec-ultrix4).

    DDD is free software, protected by the GNU general public license.
    It is actively maintained by its authors, Dorothea Luetkehaus and
    Andreas Zeller at the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig,
    Germany.


What do I need to build DDD?
============================

    To build a complete DDD from sources, you need:

       * The GNU C++ compiler (GCC/G++), preferably version 2.6.3 or
	 later, and a matching C++ I/O library (libstdc++ or libg++).

         Some other C++ compilers have been reported to compile DDD as
         well, such as Sun CC 4.0, AIX xlC and SGI CC.  Cfront 3.0
         does not compile DDD.  Prefer GCC if you can - for example,
         DDD has been reported to fail when compiled with SGI CC.

       * The X window library (Xlib) and X toolkit library (Xt),
         X11R4 or later.

       * A Motif Widget library, version 1.1 or later.  Best results
         are achieved using OSF/Motif 2.0.  DDD now also compiles and
         runs with LessTif, a free Motif clone, release 0.79 or later,
         without loss of functionality.  LessTif is available via
         `http://www.lesstif.org/'.

       * Optionally, in addition to the Motif widget library, the
         Athena Widget library (release 5 or later).  Having the
         Athena Widget library is convenient for supporting
         two-dimensional scrollbars and the `editres' protocol.

       * Lots of virtual memory.

    To run DDD, you need an inferior command-line debugger.  Best
    results are achieved with GDB, the GNU debugger.  (GDB 4.x is
    required; best results are achieved with GDB 4.13 or later.)
    Using GDB, you can debug programs written in C and C++; GNU Ada
    (`gnat'), GNU Fortran (`g77') and GNU Modula-2 have been reported
    to work as well.

    As an alternative to GDB, DDD also supports the DBX debugger as
    found on SUN, DEC, AIX, and IRIX systems.  Using DBX, you can
    debug programs written in C, C++, Pascal, Fortran, and Modula-2.
    DDD adapts automatically to a wide range of other DBX variants.

    As another alternative, DDD also supports the XDB debugger as
    found on HP-UX systems.  XDB usage has been tested for C programs
    only, but may work for other languages as well.


Where do I get more information?
================================

    The DDD WWW page (including screen shots) is installed at

        http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/

    A short DDD survey with several screen shots is available at

        ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/ddd-paper.ps.gz

    The six-page paper gives a short introduction to the look-and-feel
    of DDD and highlights some internal aspects.

    The DDD manual is the official, up-to-date DDD reference.  It now
    includes more than 30 screen shots.  Available at

        ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/doc/

    The DDD users mailing list, 

        ddd-users@ips.cs.tu-bs.de

    is the right place to contact other DDD users for assistance and
    hints.  New DDD releases are also announced here.  For more
    information on this list, and for subscription, send a mail to

        ddd-users-request@ips.cs.tu-bs.de

    Please send suggestions and bug reports for DDD to

        ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de

    As the DDD developers are often busy with other projects, don't
    expect an immediate personal answer.  We try to resolve and fix
    all reported bugs as soon as possible.
