What's new in DDD?
==================

    DDD 2.2 brings persistent sessions, an improved user interface,
    attaching to running processes, display shortcuts, and more.

    User-visible changes to DDD 2.1:
    - Persistent sessions.  You can now save the entire debugger and
      process state and resume the session later.  Saved state
      includes process memory and state, inferior debugger settings,
      breakpoints, and data displays.  (Requires GDB.)
    - DDD now implements X11R6 session support.  When used with a
      session manager, DDD saves and restores its entire state.
    - Improved user interface:
      + Source line numbers have been turned off (can be restored);
        the breakpoint area extends to the first non-blank character.
      + The `Disable ()' button for disabling displays has gone;
        displays are now enabled or disabled via `Show ()/Hide ()'.
      + The `Break at ()' and `Clear at ()' buttons have been merged
        into one single dynamic button.
      + Improved command tool.  The command tool is now always
        auto-raised and comes with window manager decorations.
      + The `Windows' menu is now called `View', complying with the
        Motif style guide.
      + Options are now grouped according to their functionality.  The
        `Options' menu has gone.  Use `Edit' instead.
      + The `Edit' menu has been completely rewritten, allowing for
        better clipboard operations.  For instance, you can now copy
        selected displays to the clipboard and paste them later.
      + Several buttons now provide pulldown menus with useful
        functions.  For instance, you can now incrementally `Show More'
        details of an object, instead of showing all details at once.
      Due to the new layout, DDD now requires less width and height.
      If you already have a `~/.dddinit' file, resize DDD manually and
      save options.
    - Display shortcuts.  Once you have changed `p' to `(char *) p'
      manually, DDD provides a menu shortcut for converting arbitrary
      values to `(char *)'.
    - Button editor.  User-defined buttons can now be defined,
      changed, and deleted at run-time.
    - Support for debugging processes running outside of DDD.  You can
      attach to a running process, examine it, and resume execution.
    - Improved online manuals:
      + Multiple manual browsers are supported.
      + Manual browsers are realized as top-level windows.
      + DDD no longer blocks while the manual is uncompressed and formatted.
      + DDD manuals are now stored in `gzip' format, saving space in
        executables.
    - New `What Next' help.  Gives a hint on what to do next,
      depending on current state.  Useful for beginners.
    - Data displayed in the data window is now highlighted whenever it
      changes.
    - User-defined DDD commands.  DDD now provides a simple facility
      that allows the inferior debugger to execute DDD commands.  For
      details, see `User-Defined Commands' in the DDD manual.
    - For `Continue Until Here', DDD now sets a temporary breakpoint
      and continues (instead of using the GDB `until' command).  If
      the temporary breakpoint is not reached, it is deleted.
    - You can now alter the current execution position interactively
      by dragging and dropping the execution arrow.  This allows you
      to back up - perhaps with more breakpoints set-over a portion of
      a program that has already executed, in order to examine its
      execution in more detail.
    - Breakpoints can be dragged and dropped, too.
    - Improved display of breakpoints and execution positions:
      + The current execution position is now properly cleared if
        undetermined (no source, program terminated, etc.)
      + If the program stopped due to a signal, this is indicated
        by a lightning symbol within the current execution glyph.
      + Faster scrolling.  While scrolling source or machine code at
        high speed, glyphs are now unmapped.  Slow scrolling still
        shows glyphs.
    - Resource files have been renamed.  All files are now located
      under `~/.ddd/'.  The file `~/.dddinit' has been replaced by
      `~/.ddd/init'; `~/.ddd_history' is now `~/.ddd/history'.  The
      new directory `~/.ddd/sessions/' contains saved DDD sessions.
    - Your window manager should now show multi-color DDD icons.
      (requires XPM; can be disabled)
    - During start-up, DDD shows a multi-color logo in a transient
      window. (requires XPM; can be disabled)
    - Memory savings.  DDD regular expressions are now compiled during
      DDD construction (instead of being compiled during DDD
      execution).  DDD now typically requires 35% less memory.

    Bug fixes:
    - DDD now runs on Linux with GNU libc 5.4.38 and later.
    - Various fixes for XDB on HP-UX 10.x included.  Thanks to Robert
      Wiegand <wiegand@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov>.
    - DDD no longer hangs while receiving large chunks of data.
    - Significant speed-ups in processing debugger and program output.
      Processing displays can now be interrupted using Ctrl+C.
    - Several memory leaks and X resource leaks have been tightened.
    - DDD no longer requires the librx library.  Hence, librx errors
      can no more cause DDD to crash.
    - A serious bug that caused timers to be inadvertently removed has
      been fixed.  Bug effects included loss of console cursor, loss
      of data display contents, and loss of scrolling capabilities.
    - Again, several dozens of minor improvements and bug fixes.


What is DDD, anyway?
====================

    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a common graphical user
    interface to GDB, DBX, and XDB, the popular UNIX debuggers.
    Besides ``usual'' features such as viewing source texts and
    breakpoints, DDD provides a graphical data display, where data
    structures are displayed as graphs.  A simple mouse click
    dereferences pointers or reveals structure contents, updated each
    time the program stops.  Using DDD, you can reason about your
    application by viewing its data, not just by viewing it execute
    lines of source code.

    Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in C,
    C++, Ada, Fortran, Pascal, Modula-2, or Modula-3; machine-level
    debugging; hypertext source navigation and lookup; breakpoint,
    backtrace, and history editors; preferences and settings editors;
    program execution in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote
    host; on-line manual; interactive help on the Motif user
    interface; GDB/DBX/XDB command-line interface with full editing,
    history, and completion capabilities.  DDD has been designed to
    compete with well-known commercial debuggers.
    
    Speaking of platforms: DDD configures, compiles and runs
    out-of-the-box on every major UNIX platform, including AIX
    (powerpc-ibm-aix3, rs6000-ibm-aix3), FreeBSD
    (i386-intel-freebsd1), HP-UX (hppa1.1-hp-hpux9, m68k-hp-hpux9),
    IRIX (mips-sgi-irix5), Linux (i[3456]86-unknown-linux,
    i[3456]86-unknown-linuxaout), Alpha OSF (alpha-osf3), Solaris
    (i386-sun-solaris2, sparc-sun-solaris2), SunOS (sparc-sun-sunos4),
    and ULTRIX (mips-dec-ultrix4).

    DDD is free software, protected by the GNU general public license.
    It is actively maintained by its authors, Dorothea Luetkehaus and
    Andreas Zeller at the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig,
    Germany.


What do I need to build DDD?
============================

    To build a complete DDD from sources, you need:

       * The GNU C++ compiler (GCC/G++), preferably version 2.6.3 or
	 later, and a matching C++ I/O library (libstdc++ or libg++).

         Some other C++ compilers have been reported to compile DDD as
         well.  Good results have been reported with Sun CC 4.0.  SGI
         CC and AIX xlC compile DDD, but introduce some subtle errors.
         Cfront 3.0 does not compile DDD.

       * The X window library (Xlib) and X toolkit library (Xt),
         X11R4 or later.

       * A Motif Widget library, version 1.1 or later.  Best results
         are achieved using OSF/Motif 2.0.  DDD now also compiles and
         runs with LessTif, a free Motif clone, release 0.79 or later,
         without loss of functionality.  LessTif is available via
         `http://www.lesstif.org/'.

       * Optionally, in addition to the Motif widget library, the
         Athena Widget library (release 5 or later).  Having the
         Athena Widget library is convenient for supporting
         two-dimensional scrollbars and the `editres' protocol.

       * Optionally, the XPM library (release 3.2 or later).  The XPM
         library brings support for multi-color icons and logos.

       * Lots of virtual memory.

    To run DDD, you need an inferior command-line debugger.  Best
    results are achieved with GDB, the GNU debugger.  (GDB 4.x is
    required; best results are achieved with GDB 4.13 or later.)
    Using GDB, you can debug programs written in C and C++; GNU Ada
    (`gnat'), GNU Fortran (`g77') and GNU Modula-2 have been reported
    to work as well.

    As an alternative to GDB, DDD also supports the DBX debugger as
    found on SUN, DEC, AIX, and IRIX systems.  Using DBX, you can
    debug programs written in C, C++, Pascal, Fortran, and Modula-2.
    DDD adapts automatically to a wide range of DBX variants.

    As another alternative, DDD also supports the XDB debugger as
    found on HP-UX systems.  XDB usage has been tested for C programs
    only, but may work for other languages as well.
