DDD 3.0 is available					-*- text -*-
====================

Release 3.0 of the Data Display Debugger (DDD), the popular graphical
front-end for UNIX debuggers, is now available at

    ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/

DDD sources are in `src/', contributed DDD binaries are in `bin/'.
Please try a closer FTP site first; see below for a list.


What's new in DDD?
------------------

DDD 3.0 brings a new `clean' look, Java support, JDB support,
breakpoint commands, watchpoints, a further improved help system, and
several more new features and bug fixes.

For details, see the local NEWS file or the DDD WWW page at

    http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/


What do I need to build DDD?
----------------------------

Ideally, nothing - Binaries of DDD 3.0 for several architectures are
available at the DDD FTP sites.

To build DDD from sources, you need Motif - either LessTif (>= 0.83)
or OSF/Motif (>= 1.2) - and a C++ compiler, preferably GCC (>= 2.7.2).

For details, see the local INSTALL file or the DDD WWW page at
