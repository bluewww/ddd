DDD 1.2 is available
====================

    Release 1.2 of the Data Display Debugger (DDD), a graphical
    front-end for GDB and DBX debuggers, is now available by anonymous
    FTP from `ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de` [134.169.32.1] in the file
    `/pub/local/softech/ddd/ddd-1.2.tar.gz' (0.9 MB).  Diffs from
    earlier versions are in `/pub/local/softech/ddd/diffs/`.  Binaries
    for various architectures are in `/pub/local/softech/ddd/bin/`.
    Please try a closer FTP site first; see below for a list.


DDD News
========

    DDD 1.2 is again a bug fix release.  Many minor bugs have been
    fixed; see the `ChangeLog' file for details.

    Thanks to all who sent in bug reports and suggestions.

    Changes to DDD 1.1:
    - DDD source code should now be ANSI/ISO C++ conformant - all code
      specific to GCC or libg++ has been adapted.  DDD now also
      compiles using other C++ compilers than GCC (Sun's CC 4.0 works
      fine; AT&T Cfront 3.0 has trouble with some inline functions).
    - DDD should now run correctly on SGI/IRIX machines.
    - Interrupting processes via the Interrupt button now works
      correctly on Solaris, HP-UX, and other systems.
    - Improved support for GDB artificial arrays.
    - The GDB command window has improved control character support.
      Tabs, Carriage returns, Backspaces and so on are processed
      correctly.  Unprintable characters are also handled.
    - There is an option to suppress X warnings.  This may be useful
      for people annoyed by tons of Motif Keysym warnings.
    - We have started to compile a FAQ list to reduce our daily mail
      load.  See the file `FAQ' for details.

    As building DDD is still a major challenge for some users, we
    encourage everyone to share her/his binaries with others.  See the
    file ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de:/pub/local/softech/ddd/bin/README for
    details.



Summary of DDD
==============

    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a novel graphical user
    interface to GDB and DBX, the popular UNIX debuggers.  Besides
    ``usual'' features such as viewing source texts and breakpoints,
    DDD provides a *graphical data display*, where data structures are
    displayed as graphs.  A simple mouse click dereferences pointers
    or views structure contents.  Complex data structures can be
    explored incrementally and interactively, using automatic layout
    if preferred.  Each time the program stops, the data display
    reflects the current variable values.  Using DDD, you can reason
    about your application by viewing its data, not just by viewing it
    execute lines of source code.

    Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in C,
    C++, Pascal, or Modula-2; hypertext source navigation and lookup;
    GDB/DBX command-line interface with full editing, history, and
    completion capabilities; breakpoint, backtrace, and history
    editors; optional program execution in terminal emulator window;
    debugging on remote host; on-line manual; interactive help on the
    OSF/Motif user interface.  DDD has been designed to compete with
    well-known commercial debuggers.

    DDD has been extensively beta-tested (especially by debugging
    itself) and should configure, compile and run out-of-the-box for a
    variety of UNIX brands, including AIX (powerpc-ibm-aix3,
    rs6000-ibm-aix3), HP-UX (hppa1.1-hp-hpux9), IRIX (mips-sgi-irix5),
    Linux (i386-unknown-linux, i486-unknown-linux), Solaris
    (i386-sun-solaris2 sparc-sun-solaris2), SunOS (sparc-sun-sunos4),
    and ULTRIX (mips-dec-ultrix4).

    DDD is free software, protected by the GNU general public license.
    It is actively maintained by its authors, Dorothea Luetkehaus and
    Andreas Zeller at the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig, Germany.



Requirements
============

    To build a complete DDD from sources, you need:

       * The GNU C++ compiler (GCC/G++), version 2.6.3, and a matching
	 C++ I/O library (libg++, libstdc++, or libiostream).

         Some other C++ compilers have been reported to compile DDD as
         well, such as Sun CC 4.0.  Cfront 3.0 does not compile DDD.

       * The X window library (Xlib) and X toolkit library (Xt),
         X11R4 or later.

       * The OSF/Motif Widget library (release 1.1 or later).  Best
         results are achieved using Motif 2.0 in conjunction with the
         Athena Widget library.

       * Optionally, in addition to the OSF/Motif widget library, the
         Athena Widget library (release 5 or later).  Having the
         Athena Widget library is convenient for supporting
         two-dimensional scrollbars and the `editres' protocol.

    To run DDD, you need a GDB debugger (version 4 is required; best
    results are achieved with 4.13 or later).  Using GDB, you can
    debug programs written in C and C++.

    As an alternative, DDD also supports Sun's DBX debugger.  Using
    DBX, you can additionally debug programs written in Pascal and
    Modula-2.  DBX debuggers on other systems may work, too.


More Information
================

    A World-Wide-Web page (including screen shots) devoted to DDD is
    installed at `http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/software/ddd_e.html'.

    The DDD users mailing list, `ddd-users@ips.cs.tu-bs.de', is the
    right place to contact other DDD users for assistance and hints.
    New DDD releases and bug fixes are also announced here.
    Send a mail to `ddd-users-request@ips.cs.tu-bs.de' for more
    information.

    Some people and organizations offer support services for DDD.
    See the file `SERVICE' in the DDD distribution for details.

    Send suggestions and bug reports for DDD to `ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de'.



DDD source FTP sites
====================

    The DDD source package `ddd-1.2.tar.gz' will soon be at these FTP
    sites as well.  Please try them before `ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de' since
    ftp.ips has a slow network connection.

DDD binary sites
================

    DDD pre-compiled binaries are available for a variety of
    architectures.  This may be useful for people who lack GCC or
    Motif.  However, compiling DDD on your machine is strongly
    preferred.  Use binaries as a last resort only.

    The `README' file contains a list of available binaries.
    Additional contributions are very welcome.
