DDD 1.3 is available
====================

    Release 1.3 of the Data Display Debugger (DDD), a graphical
    front-end for GDB and DBX debuggers, is now available by anonymous
    FTP from `ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de` [134.169.32.1] in the file
    `/pub/local/softech/ddd/ddd-1.3.tar.gz' (1.0 MB).  Diffs from
    earlier versions are in `/pub/local/softech/ddd/diffs/`.  Binaries
    for various architectures are in `/pub/local/softech/ddd/bin/`.
    Please try a closer FTP site first; see below for a list.


DDD News
========

    DDD 1.3 now compiles using GCC 2.7; some new features have been
    added and several minor bugs fixed.  Some bugs remain; see the
    `BUGS' file for details.

    Changes to DDD 1.2:
    - You can now edit the current source via an external editor.
    - Display placement has been improved; new displays are now
      created in the current visible view, if possible.
    - The current execution position now stays near the middle of the
      visible source code.  Following statements remain visible.
    - Diagnostics of printing commands no longer get lost.
    - Upon fatal errors, DDD tries to resume execution by returning to
      the main event loop.  This leaves you a chance for exiting the
      debugged program properly.
    - New `Help on Debugging' item.
      Written by David A. Lyons (dlyons@apple.com).
    - A short DDD survey, including lots of screen shots, is included
      in `doc/ddd-paper.ps'.  The paper also describes some DDD innards.
    - DDD source code has been adapted to the current ANSI/ISO C++
      draft standard.  Any GCC release from 2.3.3 onwards, including
      the recent GCC 2.7.0, should now compile DDD (unjustified
      commpiler warnings in GCC 2.5 or lower, though).
    - DBX support on Solaris improved.
      Thanks to grant@isgtec.com (Grant McDorman)
    - Patches for FreeBSD incorporated.
      Thanks to smcarey@mailbox.syr.edu (Shawn M. Carey).
    - DDD-specific application defaults now override user application
      defaults.  Thanks to ksfdo0@ksepl.shell.nl (Fred Donck).
    - New GNU librx 0.07.2 library included (from libg++-2.7.0),
      should be faster and more reliable.

    Thanks to all who sent in bug reports and suggestions.  DDD now
    runs on every major UNIX flavour (with the exception of OSF/1 -
    any volunteers for that task?).



Summary of DDD
==============

    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a novel graphical user
    interface to GDB and DBX, the popular UNIX debuggers.  Besides
    ``usual'' features such as viewing source texts and breakpoints,
    DDD provides a *graphical data display*, where data structures are
    displayed as graphs.  A simple mouse click dereferences pointers
    or reveals structure contents.  Complex data structures can be
    explored incrementally and interactively, using automatic layout
    if preferred.  Each time the program stops, the data display
    reflects the current variable values.  Using DDD, you can reason
    about your application by viewing its data, not just by viewing it
    execute lines of source code.

    Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in C,
    C++, Pascal, or Modula-2; hypertext source navigation and lookup;
    GDB/DBX command-line interface with full editing, history, and
    completion capabilities; breakpoint, backtrace, and history
    editors; optional program execution in terminal emulator window;
    debugging on remote host; on-line manual; interactive help on the
    OSF/Motif user interface.  DDD has been designed to compete with
    well-known commercial debuggers.

    DDD has been extensively beta-tested (especially by debugging
    itself) and should configure, compile and run out-of-the-box for a
    variety of UNIX brands, including AIX (powerpc-ibm-aix3,
    rs6000-ibm-aix3), HP-UX (hppa1.1-hp-hpux9), IRIX (mips-sgi-irix5),
    Linux (i386-unknown-linux, i486-unknown-linux), Solaris
    (i386-sun-solaris2 sparc-sun-solaris2), SunOS (sparc-sun-sunos4),
    and ULTRIX (mips-dec-ultrix4).

    DDD is free software, protected by the GNU general public license.
    It is actively maintained by its authors, Dorothea Luetkehaus and
    Andreas Zeller at the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig, Germany.



Requirements
============

    To build a complete DDD from sources, you need:

       * The GNU C++ compiler (GCC/G++), (preferably release 2.6.3 or
         later), and a matching C++ I/O library (libg++, libstdc++, or
         libiostream).

         Some other C++ compilers have been reported to compile DDD as
         well, such as Sun CC 4.0.  Cfront 3.0 does not compile DDD.

       * The X window library (Xlib) and X toolkit library (Xt),
         X11R4 or later.

       * The OSF/Motif Widget library (release 1.1 or later).  Best
         results are achieved using Motif 2.0 in conjunction with the
         Athena Widget library.

       * Optionally, in addition to the OSF/Motif widget library, the
         Athena Widget library (release 5 or later).  Having the
         Athena Widget library is convenient for supporting
         two-dimensional scrollbars and the `editres' protocol.

    To run DDD, you need a GDB debugger (version 4 is required; best
    results are achieved with 4.13 or later).  Using GDB, you can
    debug programs written in C and C++.

    As an alternative, DDD also supports Sun's DBX debugger.  Using
    DBX, you can additionally debug programs written in Pascal and
    Modula-2.  DBX debuggers on other systems may work, too.


More Information
================

    A World-Wide-Web page (including screen shots) devoted to DDD is
    installed at `http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/software/ddd_e.html'.

    A short DDD survey with several screen shots is available at
    `ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de:/pub/local/softech/ddd/ddd-paper.ps.gz'.
    The six-page paper gives a short introduction to the
    ``look-and-feel'' of DDD and highlights some internal aspects.

    The DDD users mailing list, `ddd-users@ips.cs.tu-bs.de', is the
    right place to contact other DDD users for assistance and hints.
    New DDD releases and bug fixes are also announced here.
    Send a mail to `ddd-users-request@ips.cs.tu-bs.de' for more
    information.

    Some people and organizations offer support services for DDD.
    See the file `SERVICE' in the DDD distribution for details.

    Send suggestions and bug reports for DDD to `ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de'.



DDD source FTP sites
====================

    The DDD source package `ddd-1.3.tar.gz' will soon be at these FTP
    sites as well.  Please try them before `ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de' since
    ftp.ips has a slow network connection.

DDD full FTP sites
==================

    Besides DDD source packages, the sites listed here also carry DDD
    binaries and patches as well as formatted DDD documentation and
    DDD-related papers.

    DDD pre-compiled binaries are available for a variety of
    architectures.  This may be useful for people who lack GCC or
    Motif.  However, compiling DDD on your machine is strongly
    preferred.  Use binaries as a last resort only.

    The `bin/README' file contains a list of available binaries.
    Additional contributions are very welcome.
