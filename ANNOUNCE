DDD News
========

    DDD 1.4 realizes the top ten suggestions of DDD users.  It brings
    the long awaited machine code support, new breakpoint and
    execution symbols, improved DBX support, enhanced integration
    facilities, a program argument history, and lots of small features
    and improvements.

    Changes to DDD 1.3:
    - Full machine code support: Assembler and register windows,
      Breakpoints in machine code, no-source debugging, stepping over
      instructions.  (GDB only)
    - Breakpoints and the current execution position are now displayed
      as stop signs and arrow symbols (``glyphs'').  The `old' text
      mode is still available.
    - Argument history: Upon program start, select from a list of
      previously used program arguments.
    - Using the new `--tty' option, DDD can be easily integrated with
      other GDB/DBX front-ends.  For instance, you can have DDD run as
      an inferior debugger from your Emacs GDB-mode, having all Emacs
      and DDD facilities at your disposition.
    - Improved C++ support with DBX 3.x.  Thanks to Grant McDorman
      <grant@isgtec.com>.
    - Displays with format expressions (`/x') are properly
      dereferenced.
    - Improved position history mechanism.
    - Automatic reloading of source files when the debugged program
      has changed; explicit reload is no longer required.
    - File selection dialogs are synchronized: changing the directory
      in one dialog also changes the directory in all others.
    - Interactive dialogs for disambiguating C++ names.
    - Several major and minor bugs have been fixed.  Special thanks to
      Grant McDorman <grant@isgtec.com>.
    - DDD incorporates the name of its builder in `Help/Show Version'.
    - No more `Help on Debugging' item.  Sigh.
    - Compilation trouble with older GCC versions as well as 
      older C++ compilers fixed.
    - Compilation in separate directory fixed.
    - For older GDB versions, one may use `display /x $pc' and `print
      /x $pc' to get the current PC value.
    - Minor bugs in construction and installation fixed.
    - Much faster start-up, due to delayed parsing of the VSL library.
    - Custom paper size support for printing graphs.
    - Paper size and printing command is saved with options.
    - On some X11 configurations, DDD was caught in a busy loop upon
      invocation.  Now fixed.
    - On some Linux configurations, DDD crashed immediately upon
      invocation.  Now fixed.
    - Manual update of data display (`graph refresh') improved.
    - `set' and `assign' commands automatically update the data
      display.
    - New releases of top-level `configure' and `libiberty' included.
    - Building DDD creates executable with canonical name.


Summary of DDD
==============

    The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a comfortable graphical user
    interface to GDB and DBX, the popular UNIX debuggers.  Besides
    ``usual'' features such as viewing source texts and breakpoints, DDD
    provides a *graphical data display*, where data structures are
    displayed as graphs.  A simple mouse click dereferences pointers or
    reveals structure contents.  Complex data structures can be explored
    incrementally and interactively, using automatic layout if preferred.
    Each time the program stops, the data display reflects the current
    variable values.  Using DDD, you can reason about your application by
    viewing its data, not just by viewing it execute lines of source
    code.

    Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in C,
    C++, Ada, Fortran, Pascal, or Modula-2; machine-level debugging;
    hypertext source navigation and lookup; GDB/DBX command-line
    interface with full editing, history, and completion capabilities;
    breakpoint, backtrace, and history editors; optional program
    execution in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote host;
    on-line manual; interactive help on the OSF/Motif user interface.
    DDD has been designed to compete with well-known commercial
    debuggers.

    DDD has been extensively beta-tested (especially by debugging
    itself) and configures, compiles and runs out-of-the-box on every
    major UNIX brand, including AIX (powerpc-ibm-aix3,
    rs6000-ibm-aix3), FreeBSD (i386-intel-freebsd1), HP-UX
    (hppa1.1-hp-hpux9, m68k-hp-hpux9), IRIX (mips-sgi-irix5), Linux
    (i[345]86-unknown-linux, i[345]86-unknown-linuxaout), Alpha OSF
    (alpha-osf3), Solaris (i386-sun-solaris2, sparc-sun-solaris2),
    SunOS (sparc-sun-sunos4), and ULTRIX (mips-dec-ultrix4).

    DDD is free software, protected by the GNU general public license.
    It is actively maintained by its authors, Dorothea Luetkehaus and
    Andreas Zeller at the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig,
    Germany.



Requirements
============

    To build a complete DDD from sources, you need:

    * The GNU C++ compiler (GCC/G++, preferably release 2.6.3 or
      later), and a matching C++ I/O library (libg++, libstdc++, or
      libiostream).

      Some other C++ compilers have been reported to compile DDD as
      well, such as Sun CC 4.0.  Cfront 3.0 does not compile DDD.

    * The X window library (Xlib) and X toolkit library (Xt), X11R4 or
      later.

    * The OSF/Motif Widget library (release 1.1 or later).  Best
      results are achieved using Motif 2.0 in conjunction with the
      Athena Widget library.

    * Optionally, in addition to the OSF/Motif widget library, the
      Athena Widget library (release 5 or later).  Having the Athena
      Widget library is convenient for supporting two-dimensional
      scrollbars and the `editres' protocol.

    * Lots of virtual memory.

    To run DDD, you need a GDB debugger (version 4 is required; best
    results are achieved with 4.13 or later).  Using GDB, you can
    debug programs written in C and C++; GNU Ada (`gnat'), GNU
    Fortran (`g77') and GNU Modula-2 have been reported to work as
    well.

    As an alternative, DDD also supports Sun's DBX debugger.  Using
    DBX, you can debug programs written in C, C++, Pascal and
    Modula-2.  DBX debuggers on systems other than Sun have been
    reported to work as well.


More Information
================

    A World-Wide-Web page (including screen shots) devoted to DDD is
    installed at

        http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/

    A short DDD survey with several screen shots is available at

        ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/ddd-paper.ps.gz

    The six-page paper gives a short introduction to the
    ``look-and-feel'' of DDD and highlights some internal aspects.

    The DDD users mailing list, `ddd-users@ips.cs.tu-bs.de', is the
    right place to contact other DDD users for assistance and hints.
    New DDD releases and bug fixes are also announced here.  Send a
    mail to `ddd-users-request@ips.cs.tu-bs.de' for more information
    on this list and how to subscribe.

    Some people and organizations offer support services for DDD.  See
    the file `SERVICE' in the DDD distribution for details.

    Send suggestions and bug reports for DDD to `ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de'.



DDD source FTP sites
====================

    The DDD source package `ddd-1.4d.tar.gz' will soon be at these FTP
    sites as well.  Please try them before `ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de' since
    ftp.ips has a slow network connection.

DDD full FTP sites
==================

    Besides DDD source packages, the sites listed here also carry DDD
    binaries and patches as well as formatted DDD documentation and
    DDD-related papers.

    DDD pre-compiled binaries are available for a variety of
    architectures.  This may be useful for people who lack GCC or Motif.
    However, compiling DDD on your machine is strongly preferred.  Use
    binaries as a last resort only.

    The `bin/README' file contains a list of available binaries.
    Additional contributions are very welcome.
