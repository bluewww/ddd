DDD News
========

DDD 1.3c now also compiles using GCC 2.7.0 and GCC 2.7.1; some new
features have been added and several minor bugs fixed.  Some bugs
remain; see the `BUGS' file for details.

Changes to DDD 1.2:
- You can now edit the current source via an external editor.
- Display placement has been improved; new displays are now created in
  the current visible view, if possible.
- The current execution position now stays near the middle of the
  visible source code.  Following statements remain visible.
- Diagnostics of printing commands no longer get lost.
- Upon fatal errors, DDD tries to resume execution by returning to the
  main event loop.  This leaves you a chance for exiting the debugged
  program properly.
- DDD can now be interrupted using the SIGINT signal.
- In the breakpoint editor, you can now set multiple breakpoint
  conditions and ignore counts at a time.
- New `Help/on Debugging' item.  Written by David A. Lyons
  (dlyons@apple.com).
- New `Help/DDD WWW Page' item.  Invokes a WWW browser with recent DDD
  info.
- The breakpoint popup menu allows you to set a temporary 
  breakpoint and continue immediately.
- The source popup menu allows you to print or display
  dereferenced names (`print *' and `display *').
- The DDD WWW page has moved to `http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/'.
- Colors slightly reworked: text background is a little brighter.
- A short DDD survey, including lots of screen shots, is included in
  `doc/ddd-paper.ps'.  The paper also describes some DDD innards.
- DDD source code has been adapted to the current ANSI/ISO C++ draft
  standard.  Any GCC release from 2.3.3 onwards, including the recent
  GCC 2.7.0, should now compile DDD (unjustified compiler warnings in
  GCC 2.5 or lower, though).
- DBX support on Solaris improved.  Thanks to grant@isgtec.com (Grant
  McDorman)
- Patches for FreeBSD incorporated.  Thanks to smcarey@mailbox.syr.edu
  (Shawn M. Carey).
- Patches for recent Linux boxes (using ELF format) incorporated.
  Thanks to lee@champion.tcs.co.jp (Lee Hounshell).
- Patches for DEC Alpha OSF/1 incorporated; see the `PROBLEMS'
  file for special building instructions.  Thanks to
  tuppa@iue.tuwien.ac.at (Walter Tuppa)
- DDD-specific application defaults now override user application
  defaults.  Thanks to ksfdo0@ksepl.shell.nl (Fred Donck).
- New GNU librx 0.07.2 library included (from libg++-2.7.0), should be
  faster and more reliable.
- Configuration scripts reworked for GNU autoconf 2.6; various
  configuration bugs have been fixed.

Thanks to all who sent in bug reports and suggestions.  This DDD
release should compile and run on every major UNIX flavor, including
OSF/1 and Linux (a.out and ELF format).



Summary of DDD
==============

The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a novel graphical user interface to
GDB and DBX, the popular UNIX debuggers.  Besides ``usual'' features
such as viewing source texts and breakpoints, DDD provides a
*graphical data display*, where data structures are displayed as
graphs.  A simple mouse click dereferences pointers or reveals
structure contents.  Complex data structures can be explored
incrementally and interactively, using automatic layout if preferred.
Each time the program stops, the data display reflects the current
variable values.  Using DDD, you can reason about your application by
viewing its data, not just by viewing it execute lines of source code.

Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in C, C++,
Pascal, or MODULA-2; hypertext source navigation and lookup; GDB/DBX
command-line interface with full editing, history, and completion
capabilities; breakpoint, backtrace, and history editors; optional
program execution in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote
host; on-line manual; interactive help on the OSF/Motif user
interface.  DDD has been designed to compete with well-known
commercial debuggers.

DDD has been extensively beta-tested (especially by debugging itself)
and configures, compiles and runs out-of-the-box on almost every major
UNIX brand, including AIX (powerpc-ibm-aix3, rs6000-ibm-aix3), FreeBSD
(i386-intel-freebsd1), HP-UX (hppa1.1-hp-hpux9, m68k-hp-hpux9), IRIX
(mips-sgi-irix5), Linux (i386-unknown-linux, i486-unknown-linux; a.out
and ELF support), Alpha OSF (alpha-osf3), Solaris (i386-sun-solaris2,
sparc-sun-solaris2), SunOS (sparc-sun-sunos4), and ULTRIX
(mips-dec-ultrix4).

DDD is free software, protected by the GNU general public license.  It
is actively maintained by its authors, Dorothea Luetkehaus and Andreas
Zeller at the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig, Germany.



Requirements
============

To build a complete DDD from sources, you need:

* The GNU C++ compiler (GCC/G++, preferably release 2.6.3 or later),
  and a matching C++ I/O library (libg++, libstdc++, or libiostream).

  Some other C++ compilers have been reported to compile DDD as well,
  such as Sun CC 4.0.  Cfront 3.0 does not compile DDD.

* The X window library (Xlib) and X toolkit library (Xt), X11R4 or
  later.

* The OSF/Motif Widget library (release 1.1 or later).  Best results
  are achieved using Motif 2.0 in conjunction with the Athena Widget
  library.

* Optionally, in addition to the OSF/Motif widget library, the Athena
  Widget library (release 5 or later).  Having the Athena Widget
  library is convenient for supporting two-dimensional scrollbars and
  the `editres' protocol.

To run DDD, you need a GDB debugger (version 4 is required; best
results are achieved with 4.13 or later).  Using GDB, you can debug
programs written in C and C++.

As an alternative, DDD also supports Sun's DBX debugger.  Using DBX,
you can additionally debug programs written in Pascal and MODULA-2.
DBX debuggers on other systems may work, too.


More Information
================

A World-Wide-Web page (including screen shots) devoted to DDD is
installed at

    http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/

A short DDD survey with several screen shots is available at

    ftp://ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/softech/ddd/ddd-paper.ps.gz

The six-page paper gives a short introduction to the ``look-and-feel''
of DDD and highlights some internal aspects.

The DDD users mailing list, `ddd-users@ips.cs.tu-bs.de', is the right
place to contact other DDD users for assistance and hints.  New DDD
releases and bug fixes are also announced here.  Send a mail to
`ddd-users-request@ips.cs.tu-bs.de' for more information.

Some people and organizations offer support services for DDD.  See the
file `SERVICE' in the DDD distribution for details.

Send suggestions and bug reports for DDD to `ddd-bugs@ips.cs.tu-bs.de'.



DDD source FTP sites
====================

The DDD source package `ddd-1.3c.tar.gz' will soon be at these FTP
sites as well.  Please try them before `ftp.ips.cs.tu-bs.de' since
ftp.ips has a slow network connection.

DDD full FTP sites
==================

Besides DDD source packages, the sites listed here also carry DDD
binaries and patches as well as formatted DDD documentation and
DDD-related papers.

DDD pre-compiled binaries are available for a variety of
architectures.  This may be useful for people who lack GCC or Motif.
However, compiling DDD on your machine is strongly preferred.  Use
binaries as a last resort only.

The `bin/README' file contains a list of available binaries.
Additional contributions are very welcome.
